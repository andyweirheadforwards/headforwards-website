[The Cornwall Business Awards 2017](http://www.cornwallbusinessawards.co.uk/) are nearly upon us and we are thrilled to have made it to the shortlist for Employer of the Year and Most Dynamic Growth Business! On top of that, Lyssa-Fee Crump, Catalyst of Disruptive Innovation here at Headforwards, has been shortlisted for Young Business Person of the Year.

This year marks the 12th year of these awards. Held on the 18th of May at the stylish St Mellion International Resort, this event celebrates not only the people and businesses that help to drive the Cornish economy but also Cornwall as a whole as a great place to do business.

The Cornwall Business Awards 2017 are organised and presented by [Cornwall Development Company](http://www.cornwalldevelopmentcompany.co.uk/) in association with [Business Cornwall Magazine](https://www.businesscornwall.co.uk/) and the [Cornwall Chamber](http://www.cornwallchamber.co.uk/).

The judging panel is made up of over 30 representatives from a variety of local businesses and the qualities that the judges will reward are true to Cornwall’s ethos. They will reward businesses within Cornwall that are thriving and that are using the county as a base for achieving strong national and even international growth, and those that bring significant benefit to the county.

Being shortlisted for Dynamic Growth and Employer of the year makes us incredibly proud. In less than 6 years Headforwards has grown from a spark of an idea to a team of over 90 people with clients across the globe. In the last twelve months alone we have taken on 35 new employees with 8 new starters already this year, whilst also expanding our offering. This wouldn’t have been possible without a happy, productive team of people. We really understand the need to enable our employees to have a great work-life balance, take a look at some of the [benefits of working at Headforwards](https://www.headforwards.com/benefits-working-headforwards/).

Congratulations to all the other finalists, we’re looking forward to seeing you all there on the night!
