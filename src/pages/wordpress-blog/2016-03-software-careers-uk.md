Here at Headforwards, we are pleased to be offering rewarding software careers in the UK.

As an outsource software development company we get to work with lots of different clients on exciting projects.  
These projects vary drastically from each other, and we hire developers with a range of different language specialities.

Our outsource model is different to most companies. We don’t hire developers to have them sitting ‘on the bench’ waiting for some work to come up that they might be suited for.

We work with our clients on long term projects and recruit specifically for those roles.  That means that you, as an applicant, know which of our clients you will be working with, and on what project.  
You will have continuity and stability in your role, which in turn leads to higher productivity levels.

At the moment we have a few exciting roles available working on various projects at Headforwards.

We are looking for [.NET Developers](https://www.headforwards.com/careers/net-developer/) to work with an existing client on a new project. We are looking for developers who have experience in .NET 4.5, C# and ASP.NET MVC 5.  JavaScript, HTML and CSS are also required skills.  
It would be beneficial if you have experience or knowledge of Agile software development methods.

We are also looking for an experienced [Perl Developer](https://www.headforwards.com/careers/perl-developer/) to join our team working on a project for one of the largest telecoms companies in the world. We are also willing to receive applications from C or C++ Developers. It is essential that you already have experience working within Agile frameworks such as Scrum, Kanban and XP.

We have a position for a [Python Developer](https://www.headforwards.com/careers/python-developer/) to join one of our teams on an existing project. Again we would accept C or C++. Front end experience with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript or AJAX would be a benefit. The ability to be able to work well in a team is essential, and Agile experience would be a bonus.

We are looking for [QA Software Testers](https://www.headforwards.com/careers/qa-software-tester/) to join our team on a new project. You will need to have at least 1 years experience as a QA and have experience of test web based applications and of test automation and SpecFlow.  This is a perfect opportunity for someone who is passionate about helping their team deliver high quality code.

We are offering software careers in the UK and they are all based at Headforwards HQ in Cornwall. Cornwall is famous for its cuisine, stunning coastline and spectacular beaches. Being based here has helped us perfect our work life balance along with our company culture.  
Happy developers who feel valued and are working well as a team produce the best work. We work hard to create an environment that allows this.

If you are interested in becoming part of the Headforwards family, please [contact us](https://www.headforwards.com/careers/application-form/).  
We are looking forward to hearing from you.
