On Friday 19th June Headforwards organised a beach BBQ  for the team and their families.  
So at 1730 we shut down our computers, collected our loved ones and headed to [Trevaunance Cove](https://www.visitcornwall.com/beaches/north-cornwall/st-agnes/trevaunance-cove-beach#.VYfSlRNVhBc), in St Agnes. 

The sun was shining and it was beautifully warm, perfect beach weather!

Even though the tide was pretty high we all had a great time munching our dinner on what remained of the sand. A few of the team even managed to get into the sea for a quick swim, that is one of the benefits of the tide being so high, it as not as far to walk to get to the water!

[Toby](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobyparkins), [Karen](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/karen-russell/67/42/158) and [Craig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/craiggirvan) performed their Grill Master duties excellently managing to fill up the 100+ people eagerly awaiting some BBQ. 

Take a look at some of the photos we took on this beautiful summers evening, if you click on one image it will open them up in a slideshow.
