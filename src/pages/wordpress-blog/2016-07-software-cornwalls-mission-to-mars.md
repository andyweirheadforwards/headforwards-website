_Earlier this month it was Software Cornwall’s Mission to Mars work experience week._  
_[Software Cornwall](https://www.softwarecornwall.org/) run regular [Missions to Mars](https://www.softwarecornwall.org/?s=mission+to+mars), but this was by far the biggest one._

_Software Cornwall is a not for profit organisation run by its members, with the aim of raising the profile of the industry in the county, offering business support to its members, and helping to bridge the skills gap._  
_Their Mission to Mars events are just one of the many things they are doing with the students to help encourage and inspire them._

_The member businesses of Software Cornwall are often inundated by requests from students to come and do their work experience with them. However shadowing a developer for two weeks would not be the most exciting thing for them to do nor is it the best way for them to learn. So it was decided that Software Cornwall would organise a special work experience Mission to Mars event._  
_The interest in the event was overwhelming, in the end there were 35 students on the mission!_

_One of the work experience places was filled by Georgia, the daughter of one of our own developers. Following in her fathers footsteps she spent her first week on Software Cornwall’s Mission to Mars and her second week here with us at Headforwards._  
_She very kindly wrote the following review about her Mission to Mars experience:_

“The Mission to Mars project is run by a group of really friendly programmers. They made everyone talk to people they didn’t know by separating groups of friends who had all sat together, so we learned how to talk to others. This was both scary but useful to introverts such as myself as talking to new people is quite stressful to me, but it did help with my confidence. Within a few days we were all really good friends.

The first thing we had to do was assemble a Raspberry Pi, of which they had the newest model. This was actually funded by the kickstarters they had run and companies who were interested by the times they had done the Mission to Mars project before, however they had to pay for a few themselves as there were more students than they had expected.

We were also supplied with LEDs, a breadboard, an Arduino, several wires, light sensors, distance sensors and buttons. The software we used on the Pi was Arduino IDE, in which we used C++ to program the two mini-rovers (named Bert and Ernie).

We set up the breadboard using a diagram on how with the LEDs to simulate the engines, set up on the Arduino as they are on Bert and Ernie so that we could test our functions without using too much of our digital money on robot time.

The digital money was set up so that we were charged for using the robots (£1 per minute) but we were paid for each task we completed.

These tasks were set in the form of stories (“as a…. I want a…. to do…”), so we were never out of things to do. Some of these stories were easy and we had to do things such as make the robot go forwards for a second then backwards for a second. The hardest one was, surprisingly, the one that seemed the simplest which was making the robot go in a straight line. The motor powers were deliberately different from each other so that we would have to account for the difference between these. It mainly took a lot of trail an error, though many people were actually trying to work out angles and distances with protractors. I think that this only confused them more as my group was one of the first to get it done and we just used trial and error. We did use maths for the one after that though, as we needed to work out what the speed of the robot was so that we could use this to find the time it had to travel for so that it would go exactly two meters then stop. My particular group got this on the first try.

Throughout the week, we had lots of input from the other groups and contributed to their code so that we could improve our code. Even if it works, it needs to be clear to other people who read the code instead of being confused by long-winded methods.

Although a lot of what we did was independent and using examples or our own memory and logic, there were always several mentors in the room who would sometimes see how we were doing and they were always happy to help.

On Friday, we presented what we had done to the rest of the groups as well as other companies who might want to support Software Cornwall or who have funded the project and wanted to see what the students did.

This was also really good for my confidence as part of the new English GCSE is Spoken Language, which is a presentation films in front of a class and teachers. This presentation was like practice for that; we had to talk about what we had done, if and how we could have improved as well as taking questions at the end. The people running it had made us set up the presentations in such a way that everybody had to talk by themselves for more than two sentences as we had to talk about how each of us had contributed to the project and what our background in programming is.

I personally had no experience in programming because my school didn’t offer any sort of courses in programming, but my dad is a programmer and so I’ve been interested in it for a while. However, not much had been explained to me as I don’t live in Cornwall with him very often. Everything I know about programming, I learned in Mission to Mars and I have been able to use it with my second placement with Headforwards without much help.

Altogether, the Mission to Mars project was a really fun experience and I learned something useful from it as well as making new friends and learning how to handle myself in a social situation, which is something I particularly struggle with. It was definitely worth going and I would definitely recommend it to anybody considering going, regardless of any background in programming.”
