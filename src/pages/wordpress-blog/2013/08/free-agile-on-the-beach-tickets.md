At Headforwards we believe in Agile and would like to share this with more people just like you. If you would like to attend one of the UK’s top conferences, [Agile on the Beach](http://www.agileonthebeach.com), then we’d like to help you get there.

\\Agile on the Beach is a two day conference on the Cornish coast where the UKs leading thinkers in agile adoption and evolution meet to discuss the topic in a series of talks and workshops.  
They even manage to squeeze in a beach party into the busy line up!

We are giving away 2 tickets worth £315 each to 2 lucky people who really want to attend this Agile conference on Thu and Fri, 5-6th September 2013.

All you have to do to enter is email us at [hello@headforwards.com](mailto:hello@headforwards.com) with your name, current work position, current company, why you want to attend the conference, and finally, why you would want to work at Headforwards.

The judging criteria will be based upon our judges unbiased view primarily on who needs to attend the most. Some secondary points will be given to accuracy of last answer and general humour.

The judges decision is final and there’s no cash alternative. You will need to provide your own transport to/from the event and accommodation is your responsibility but can be booked through the event website. The deadline for entries is midnight on Friday night (30th Aug 2013).
