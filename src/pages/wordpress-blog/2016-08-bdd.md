BDD – Beer Driven Development for Agile on the Beach 2016.

We are proud sponsors of [Agile on the Beach](http://agileonthebeach.com/), which is a world leading Agile conference held in Falmouth, Cornwall.  
Each year we try to give the delegates something cool to take home to remind them of the trip. We are really pleased with what we came up with for this year!

In the software world we are all use to terms like TDD, DDD and BDD . (Test Driven Development, Domain Driven Development and Behavioural Driven Development.)

However today BDD stands for something different – Beer Driven Development!

BDD as a concept was formed by the software guru [Dan North](https://twitter.com/tastapod).  

Dan describes BDD as

_“…a second-generation, outside in, pull-based, multiple-stakeholder, multiple-scale, high-automation, agile methodology. It describes a cycle of interactions with well-defined outputs, resulting in the delivery of working, tested software that matters.”_

We decided to name our AOTB beer BDD as a nod to Dan and his accomplishments as well as the Ballmer Peak. The Ballmer Peak is a reference to Steve Ballmer from Microsoft and the belief that a little bit of alcohol can improve cognitive ability and make us better coders.

Whilst we would never condone of drinking in the workplace, we do know that many great ideas and solutions to problems are sparked in the pub over a quiet drink.

If you were lucky enough to get your hands on a bottle of our finest BDD do tweet us a photo to [@Headforwards](https://twitter.com/Headforwards). We would love to see you enjoying them.

A big thanks to Lou and the team at the [Driftwood Spars Brewery](http://www.driftwoodsparsbrewery.com/) for making us another amazing beer!  
Earlier in the year they also made a fantastic beer for our birthday – Agi(a)le.
