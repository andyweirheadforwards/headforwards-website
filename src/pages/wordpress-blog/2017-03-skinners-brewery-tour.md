Our February team event was a private tour of the famous Skinner’s Brewery. We were all super excited to see behind the scenes of such a well-known Cornish beer producer. After the tour, ample quantities of tasters were available plus a tasty Cornish pasty. Free beer and free food – the ultimate combination.

The tour began with the vital ingredient to any fine brew: hops. Onwards, we were taken through the fermentation stages where huge vats of beer were slowly infusing with the hoppy goodness we all know and love.

Here are a few photos from the tour including some post-beer tasting friendly faces.
