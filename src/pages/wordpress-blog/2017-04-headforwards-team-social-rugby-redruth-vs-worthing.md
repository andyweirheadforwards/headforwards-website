Our monthly social for March was held at Redruth Rugby Football Club for the Redruth vs. Worthing rugby match. The Tribute Lounge was booked exclusively for The Headforwards Team where a huge buffet of snacks and pasties were provided. There was also an open bar to compliment the food… Much to everybody’s delight.

Around 60 people attended the event including a few family friends and children making it an enjoyable event for all ages.

Redruth put on a strong performance against visitors Worthing and set a modest score gap early on. The final score by 5pm was a close 33-29 to Redruth.
