The figures for the 2017 Tech Nation annual report are in and have got us really excited! We’re really pleased with the stats for the South West tech-cluster and how quickly it’s expanding. Tech Nation’s report provides the most comprehensive view of the UK digital tech economy and ecosystems to date.

To produce this in depth report we analysed more than 1000 data points, over 2,700 survey responses from digital tech founders and employees and incorporated insights from over 220 community partners across the UK. The findings are clear, when it comes to digital tech investment, talent and skills and digital collaboration, the UK is a leader within Europe and on the international stage.

Investment in Digital Tech reaches £6.8bn – that’s 50% higher than any other European Country. Over the past five years London has attracted more investment than Paris, Berlin and Amsterdam combined.

The average digital salary for the South West is £31,322 – this is considerably higher than non-digital salaries for the same region. 50% of tech businesses said that one of their primary issues is supply of talent – it is reported that 13% of employees are from outside of the UK.

The UK is also home to 8 of the top 20 European Universities.

We, as a tech cluster, rank in the top 10 Tech Clusters with a growth rate of 61%.
