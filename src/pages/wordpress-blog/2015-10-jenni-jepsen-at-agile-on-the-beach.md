[Lyssa](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/lyssafeecrump), _our Marketing Manager, has written the following article about Jenni Jepsen at Agile on the Beach and her Keynote entitled “Agile Leadership and Teams”_

[Jenni Jepsen](https://twitter.com/jenniindk) is a partner at [goAgile](http://www.goagile.dk/), a Denmark based Agile consulting firm who focus on helping people deliver the right product, faster. Whilst at the same creating lasting change.  
Jepsen’s keynote speech was my own personal highlight of  [Agile on the Beach](http://agileonthebeach.com/) 2015. She spent a lot of time talking about the neuroscience behind being agile, which I found absolutely fascinating.

Jepsen wanted to prove with science how agile works. MRI scans played a big part in her research, they showed which parts of the brain were firing during different tasks and she was able to discover the processes in our brains that link agile to the reward circuitry.

She started discussing the [Prefrontal Cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex), which is the thinking part of the brain. She called it the Goldilocks part of the brain- everything needs to be just right!  
She then discussed the [Limbic System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system), which is the feeling region of the brain. It is where fear and old habits come from, it also holds onto your long term memory. When the prefrontal cortex shuts down it has the effect of a short term lobotomy.

Jepsen went on to say how hearing the phrase “_Can I give you some feedback_” gives the brain the same reaction as a bear running at you in the woods. That’s rather scary isn’t it?  
I know that I can relate to this. Whilst you want to learn and grow, which can be achieved by receiving feedback, hearing someone say this to you brings up feelings of terror.

When we are stressed we do not work well.  
Jepsen showed us a graph called the “Stress Performance Curve” to demonstrate this statement.

In the work place, the most common cause of stress is having too many demands and not enough control.

The top of the curve shows the optimal amount of stress – a little stress can actually cause us to work well. It is when we are in this state that the body is producing and releasing high levels of [Dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine).

Jepsen states that if people are not performing due to stress, it is not a good idea to push them further by making them work late or work weekends and especially not by shouting at them.  Instead we should be supporting and encouraging them – enabling them to get to the high performance state.

However, sometimes people are on the lower left end of the scale and need a little push to get them into the high performance state.

When we are really stressed the prefrontal cortex stops working, which as I mentioned before has the same effect as a (temporary) lobotomy. This will not make for a productive day.

Jepsen explains that our brains are prediction machines, which is why the left hand side of the brain says “No, I don’t want that feedback”

She follows this by suggesting there is a way for us to design our interactions with people so that they work well and that it makes them happy.  
We can’t think properly when we are scared, afraid or closed to new ideas. When we are in this state we see more negativity around us and in turn become more negative ourselves.

Jepsen told us that when you have been in a high stress state for two weeks, it will take two weeks to recover from it.  This really stuck with me. I am sure we have all suffered from burn out from time to time, and have then been frustrated with ourselves at how long it takes to shake it off?  
If you spend prolonged periods of time in stress it permanently alters your brain. According to [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201406/are-we-hardwired-be-positive-or-negative) it can take 5-10 positive events to counterbalance 1 negative event.

Jepsen is quick to follow on with the revelation that you can change your brain! You can make it more positive which will enable you to think better, give us more energy to try new things and make us more curious.

Our dopamine levels increase when we feel valued, have pride in our work, have autonomy and solid team connections.

The thing about the brain is that control is just an illusion. When we make a plan, we know it will change but for the brain the act of planning for uncertainty creates certainty.

Jepsen goes on the say that autonomy is a huge influencer in releasing dopamine. We need to have influence in the work we are doing and this is why self organising teams are so successful.

Gut feelings come from deep in the Limbic System. Your brain recognises patterns and that is what gives you the feeling that something is bad for you, it does this to enable you to “run away” quickly. However the Limbic System is not so good at telling you why you should run away, you need the prefrontal cortex for this bit.

Jepsen tells us that focusing on the relationship before the task allows you to get to task quicker and enables you to devise more creative solutions to it.

She believes that agile is a fantastic way of working as it supports creativity, fairness and supportiveness. But if Agile is so great, why is it often hard to move to agile ways of working in organisations. Jepsen says it is because the first time you encounter something new the brain says it is scary. Also, sometimes not everyone understands why the change is being made which makes them reluctant to change from the “safe” world they know.

According to Jepsen it is a good idea to make these changes in an agile way. Introduce one piece at a time and trial it for 3 months. This will make the brain settle down and accept it before tackling the next change.

To end the Keynote speech we had a Q&A session with Jenni Jepsen.

She was asked what the symptoms of people being pushed too far were. She answered by saying: Negativity, body language, tiredness, lack of challenging, head aches and stomach aches. These are key things to look out for within your team.

She also said that telling people what to do shuts their brains down. By asking them how they would go about fixing something you are giving them the power. The autonomy they want.

Jepsen would recommend training your brain, try some [mindfulness](http://bemindful.co.uk/). Be in the moment.  
She use to hate when people approached her after a talk saying “Can I give you some feedback”. However she has managed to train herself to get over this by repeatedly saying _“Thank you for your feedback”._

Jepsen notes that some people are more sensitive to stress and that when it comes to teams the more diversity we have; the better the solutions.  Having diversity helps everyone.  
It is also important to give support to your team and the people around you. If they are finding something difficult to deal with try to reframe it in a more positive light. This is surprisingly effective and is also a good tool to use yourself.
