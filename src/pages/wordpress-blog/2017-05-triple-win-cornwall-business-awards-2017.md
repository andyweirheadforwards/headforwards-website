The Cornwall Business Awards are a celebration of innovation, achievement and entrepreneurial spirit within the Cornish business community. The glittering event shines a spotlight on the amazing people who help drive the Cornish economy and make it one of the best places in the country to do business.

We were honoured to be attending the 2017 awards ceremony held at the prestigious, [St Mellion International Resort](http://st-mellion.co.uk/). During the past few weeks, we have been talking about our shortlisting for a few upcoming award categories at this year’s event. We were excited to be in the running for Employer of the Year and Best Dynamic Growth. Our very own Lyssa-Fee Crump was also nominated for Young Business Person of the Year. With three possible wins prime for the taking, it was going to be a night to remember.

**The Award Categories**

The full award list covered many areas of business identifying areas of growth, innovation and entrepreneurialism.

Out of the three nominations, we were delighted to take home **Best Dynamic Growth Business** and **Young Business Person of the Year** for Lyssa-Fee Crump. On top of an already celebratory evening, we also landed **Winner of Winners** making it a triple win for the whole team here at Headforwards.

We’d like to congratulate all the individuals and businesses who shortlisted for this prestigious event. Recognition within the local, national and international community is magnified by awards events such as these and we urge others to continue applying for upcoming awards

We would also like to thank the event organisers for the huge amount of time and money that has been invested into such a glamorous and enjoyable evening.
