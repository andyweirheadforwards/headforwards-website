The Government recently announced a registration scheme for EU migrant workers and their families. This wasn’t really expected and after the Government previously have said they would support EU residents in the UK.

At Headforwards we’re really lucky to have people from a wide number of nationalities. Diversity is well recognised in improving the capability and productivity of teams. Studies have shown that more diverse teams often scrutinise facts in more detail, remain more objective, and achieve greater levels of accuracy. We have made the decision to cover the EU registration fees for our staff members, and also for their immediate families.

As we understand, this registration system will only apply if Brexit doesn’t get cancelled. Either way though, we would like to ensure everyone working at Headforwards is looked after through these challenging times.
