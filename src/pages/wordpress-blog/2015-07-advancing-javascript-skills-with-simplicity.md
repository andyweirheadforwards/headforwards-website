At the beginning of July, Headforwards sent a colleague and myself on an Advanced JavaScript course with [Kyle Simpson](http://getify.me/). This had come about after a [tweet](https://twitter.com/glengineered/status/589015462702358528) I’d posted in April  after seeing a call from Kyle for people interested in having him run workshops whilst in the UK. My tweet started a ball rolling and [Belinda Waldock](https://twitter.com/belindawaldock) from [Software Cornwall](http://www.softwarecornwall.org/)  ran with it to setup the workshops.

This was great, there had already been beginner level courses for [JavaScript in Cornwall](http://www.softwarecornwall.org/javascript-training-develop-your-programming-language-skills/), but I was really excited to get the chance to hopefully level up on some skills in a very focussed workshop which was fairly advanced. I love going to conferences where I get to meet like-minded people, gain inspiration and get some broad learning, but workshop style scenarios have always been my favourite for intense learning.

Kyle’s two day presentation and discussion followed a path through a lot of his excellent “[You Don’t Know JS](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/4853)” book series  which gets down to the nitty gritty of the language and some of the simple things we take for granted every day.

For me, it filled in some gaps in my knowledge of JavaScript, which I’ve gained mostly by following a tutorial, fixing the out of date code, looking answers up on Stack Overflow, then debugging my work in the console. I guess this is the path many of us have taken to learn JavaScript, so it was great to get some teaching from someone who knows the nuances of the language really well. Some of the later material covered has prompted me to begin exploring more of the modern additions to JavaScript provided by [ES6](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html)  and this will require reading of his book several times I think.

My favourite part was the way Kyle stripped back the Object prototype chain to provide a very simple alternative to the complex ways in which many of us try to kludge together Class based OOP in a language that already provides us with Objects. I don’t think I will be running out and refactoring all our code at work, but it’s given me pause for thought about the simplicity of code and I’m already exploring the techniques at home by rewriting tutorial code in the more simplistic way he describes as “Objects Linked to Other Objects” – OLOO . He also gave us some good suggestions for places to explore and I particularly like Rich Hickey’s “[Simplicity Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0)” speech  – which has reinforced some of the ideas I’ve been having about our code lately.

After the first day of training, many of the attendees went out for some Mexican food, drink and a round of mini-golf at [Gilmore’s](http://www.gilmoresnewquay.co.uk/) in Newquay, it was great to chat with some of the other people about their choice of tools and what they’re doing with JavaScript. Our discussion brought up the inevitable topic of frameworks and although he prefers not to use frameworks, it was very reassuring to hear Kyle validate my choice of Backbone over AngularJS for some of the same reasons I had: Backbone’s simplicity over Angular’s strange scope and it’s problem of mixing code and markup, which I’ve seen confuse a lot of front-end developers who waste time trying to find out where something is configured.

Two days of solid learning is pretty taxing and towards the end, I was fairly frazzled mentally. The course was excellent, although I would have personally liked more exercises as I am a kinaesthetic learner. I also feel we did not cover the final section on promises and asynchronous code very deeply, but I don’t feel this was a big negative as I can always go back to the books and the nature of JavaScript Promises requires a remap of your brain when you’re used to writing so much asynchronous code, I’ve seen so many different approaches in the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)  libraries I’ve been playing with recently, I guess I’m not alone.

So now, my fellow attendee and myself have the dubious honour of sharing the information we learnt with our team of eager JavaScript coders. For the rest of you out there, I would suggest what we’ve already told them:

Watch some of Kyle’s sessions at various conferences. His “[New Rules For JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4cvuuq3OKY)” video covers a lot of the material we looked at, but in a very condensed format.

Read his book series. I’ve read a couple so far each book is a nice small size which makes some possibly difficult concepts are more easy to digest. You can buy copies from [O’Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/4853)  and [Amazon ](http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&field-author=Kyle+Simpson&search-alias=books-uk&text=Kyle+Simpson&sort=relevancerank)

You can also read the free drafts on [Github](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS), but I’d recommend at least giving the guy a few £ so he can keep up the good work.

Also for any level of Front-End Developer, I’d recommend reading Rebecca Murphey’s “[Baseline](http://rmurphey.com/blog/2012/04/12/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers/)” article, which should give you an idea of the sort of things that today’s job market may require and some of the things we are doing, and looking for in people that are applying for work, at Headforwards. She’s updated it for [2015](http://rmurphey.com/blog/2015/03/23/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers-2015/) too, which means I’ve got more things to learn, although her comments on tooling for JavaScript based testing are pretty close to what we’re experiencing and tackling at the moment, but that’s a whole other article.

Finally, thanks to Kyle for his workshops, Belinda Waldock for arranging them and Headforwards for sending us. Hopefully this is the beginning of many such visits to Cornwall by respected members of the development community and we look forward to kicking more off.

Glen Pike, Headforwards
