Here at Headforwards, we are pleased to be providing a variety of jobs for graduates in Cornwall.

Due to winning some exciting new contracts we currently have 42 jobs available at Headforwards HQ at the Pool Innovation Centre.

We have a few vacancies for [Python Developers](https://www.headforwards.com/careers/python-developer/) too, so if Python, C or C++ are your languages of choice, this could be an excellent opportunity for you.

We are searching for a couple of [QA Software Testers](http://www.headforwards.com/careers/qa-software-tester/). Experience with automated testing would be a bonus, but it is not an essential.

We are an outsource software development company, however our model is different to most outsource companies.  
The developers we employ are hired to work on one specific project for one specific client. We wont move you around to work on different projects. You won’t ever be ‘sat on a bench’ waiting for work and getting bored.

Whilst this is model is unconventional, it is proving to be extremely successful. It has seen us grow in just 5 years to a team of 65, with another 42 jobs available.
