Here at [Headforwards](https://www.headforwards.com/) we like to end the summer with a bang. Our annual, mini-festival; Headstock 2016, did not disappoint.

This year we took the festivities to a whole new level. We gave Nick and his family’s land a chance to recover and relocated proceedings over to [The Quarry](http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/3211238) in [St Agnes](http://www.st-agnes.com/). Karen, Lyssa and the team had their work cut out, but they pulled off a  
spectacular event.

We decided to hold Headstock 2016 in mid September. Down here in Cornwall, we often find September has some of the best Summer weather. We were not let down!

Headstock 2016 kicked off at Midday in glorious conditions with the sun on our faces. We hired two bouncy castles for the day as well as a face painter. This kept the kids in attendance entertained for hours. The ‘assault course’ bouncy castle was a mega success. It brought out the big kid in all of us.

The theme selected by the Headstock 2016 committee was… Rainbow! All attendees were encouraged to express their colourful side. We had some stunning entries from Peter Haworth and Andras’s wife; Evelin.

Activities such as [Giant Jenga](http://www.jenga.com/) and Swingball were in full flow throughout the afternoon. These were complimented by the chilled out vibes produced by reggae duo: ‘[Konquerin Soundz](https://www.facebook.com/Konquerin-soundz-649466558406799/)‘.

Toby and Karen manned the BBQ throughout the afternoon and evening keeping our energy levels high. There’s one thing we know how to do at Headforwards and that’s BBQ!

At 6pm the party moved down into The Quarry. The Quarry as a venue allowed us to play host to several top notch Cornish bands. [Badland Blues](https://www.facebook.com/badlandsblues/), lead by Brian Hart, kickstarted the evening in groovy fashion. Next was the hugely popular [Love Gap](https://www.facebook.com/Love-Gap-128167490576442/), with Engine House bringing the live music to an end. [DJ Darren Karmaloji](https://www.facebook.com/KARMALOJl) then took us to 1am with his funky disco beats.

The music then drew to a close but the party didn’t stop there. Many carried on partying until the early hours around the campfire.

Sunday morning brought us more great sunshine which helped clear our heads. The views available at that time in the morning made us all appreciate what a fantastic place [Cornwall](http://www.cornwalls.co.uk/top_ten/beaches.htm) is to live.

We can safely say that Headstock 2016 was a great success. Here at Headforwards we place great importance of getting together as a group and spending time in each others company outside of the office. We believe this makes happy, healthy relationships that catalyse our teams productivity.
