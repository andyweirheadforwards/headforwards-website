Headforwards are extremely proud to announce that last week we were awarded the impressive accolade of being Cornish Business of the Year 2016 at the [Hub Awards](https://cornwallhub.org/).

The Hub, launched in 2003, is an exciting network that now connects over 700 members from the business community across Cornwall and Devon. It’s mission statement is _“To connect and celebrate the businesses of Cornwall through dynamic, fun and exciting networking events.”_

One of the many great networking events, and in my opinion the highlight of their calendar, is the yearly Hub Awards. This spectacular event celebrates the best Cornish business talent around and competition is always fierce to win one of their sought after prizes.

The Cornish Business of the Year 2016 award was sponsored by [Cornwall Chamber](http://www.cornwallchamber.co.uk/) and we were up against some fantastic companies. We were thrilled to be shortlisted for the award alongside [ISO Spaces](http://www.isospaces.co.uk/) and [Cornwall Solar Panels](http://www.cornwallsolarpanels.co.uk/), and to win against such great competition is incredible.

This year has been a landmark year for us here at Headforwards. We celebrated our 5th birthday; gained two new clients and a new in-house team; have grown to up to 80 staff; and earlier this month we became proud winners of the Lungfish Cup!

With 2016 culminating in winning this prestigious award it is safe to say we have a lot to celebrate, and the amazing evening put on by the Hub committee at the Penventon Hotel was a great place to start.

After walking the red carpet we were met with fantastic gin cocktails and delicious canapés, with time to mingle and size up the competition, not only for the awards, but also for best dressed! Everyone really scrubbed up well!

Once seated we were treated to a delicious 4 course meal, which was also accompanied by tasters of various gins! Throughout the evening we were entertained by the 2016 Hub Bake off final. This took the form of one short ‘episode’ played to the audience either side of the 4 course meal – I’ll keep the suspense of who won until later! – and also a really interesting Q&A with [Baker Tom](http://www.bakertom.co.uk/) himself.

Then, once we were all well fed and watered, came the awards themselves…

The Winners
===========

There were 7 awards this year; 6 standard categories and a Special Achievement award. The beautiful trophies this year were made by Susy of [Susy Ward Ceramics](http://www.krowji.org.uk/tenant/susan-ward/), based at Krowji.

This special award was given to Amanda Barlow of [Spiezia Organics](https://www.madeforlifeorganics.com/), a well deserved win for such an inspiring person.

Last, but not least, the winner of the Hub Bake-Off 2016 was…… Sarah Trethowan from [TRAC](https://www.tracservices.co.uk/?gclid=CLbu4Mif1dACFVS4GwodAB4Bhw). Just a shame there were no samples of the winning cake to try!

Of course after winning it would have been rude not to have carried on the celebrations, especially as part of the prize was a bottle of champagne kindly provided by the [Samphire Club](http://thesamphireclub.co.uk/).  
Well done to all the winners and a huge thank you to everyone involved in organising this event – it really was a night to remember and we’re lucky to be part of such a great business community here in Cornwall.

We are incredibly proud of our team here at Headforwards. Combining passion for impeccable code, value for clients, and being a key part of the growing tech industry, we are striving to keep Cornwall on the map at an international level as a hub of innovation.
