The [Cornwall Careers Show 2016](https://www.cswgroup.co.uk/cornwall-careers-show-2016/) took place on Wednesday and Thursday last week. [Software Cornwall](https://www.softwarecornwall.org/) had a stand and, together with other volunteers from the Software Cornwall community, a few members of the Headforwards team spent the two days there.  
The Royal Cornwall showground was filled with over 100 different organisations and 3300 students from 24 schools visited over the two days. It has been a great opportunity to make connections with potential future employees. Equally is has been fantastic for those students to see the myriad of different opportunities available to them, many of which they may never have previously considered.  
When I was their age I remember a 5 minute quiz on my likes and dislikes followed by a 15 minute chat with a seemingly uninterested careers advisor, which, according to many others I’ve spoken to is more help than they received.

Here at the Cornwall Careers Show these students are getting a totally different experience. All the stands had an interactive element to them – mostly giving them the chance to try out something related to the business. This was a great way to draw students in for a chat with people actually working in those jobs, and the fun element helped to engage them.  
There were representatives from many different types of businesses and other organisations from around Cornwall in attendance. All sorts of careers were covered including the emergency services, beauty therapists, the hospitality sector, the construction industry and even a circus school, and the activities on offer were even more varied than the businesses.They could try everything from making mocktails to birdhouses, going up in a cherry picker, slacklining, taking fingerprints, painting nails, making pancakes, even recording a song.

The Software Cornwall stand had a few different activities for the students to try. They could play Minecraft, which was running on a Raspberry Pi server using the Raspbian language, practice their coding using Scratch or Python to make traffic lights work, or attempt to pick up sweets using our robot arms controlled by either an X-Box controller or a more standard remote control. Getting the sweets was not as simple as it sounds and it kept us and the students entertained for hours.  
The ambition and drive of these youngsters was great to see – some seem to have their futures mapped out and others were very much dipping their toes into what’s out there. It was fantastic to see how many were interested in programming and a potential career in the tech industry and was a great reminder of the importance of communities like Software Cornwall and the events they put on.

We were really happy to be able to attend the Cornwall Careers Show and we are proud of the involvement we have in helping to inspire and inform the next generation, not only with regards to the tech sector in general but also that there are great career opportunities to be found here in Cornwall.
