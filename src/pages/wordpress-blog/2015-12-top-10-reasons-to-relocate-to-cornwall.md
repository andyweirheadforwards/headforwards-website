Headforwards are based in Cornwall and we love living and working here.

It can be a bit of an adjustment if you are use to busy city life, but we feel it is well worth the change of pace.  
Here our are top 10 reasons to relocate to Cornwall:

**1\. The beaches**  
Cornwall is famous for its spectacular beaches and stunning coastline that stretches for over 250 miles! Some are small and secluded like [Rinsey Cove](http://www.cornwall-beaches.co.uk/helston-lizard-falmouth/rinsey-cove.htm). Others like [Perranporth](http://www.perranporthinfo.co.uk/)  have miles of sand and sea framed by the [Watering Hole](http://www.thewateringhole.co.uk/) beach bar!  
What ever is your favourite type of beach, you will be able to find it in Cornwall.

**2\. The sea**  
It is not surprising that water sports are popular in Cornwall. Surfing is considered a national pastime and other sports such as kayaking, sailing and  stand-up paddle boarding are also very popular. In fact [St Agnes](http://www.st-agnes.com/) is home to the [World Belly Board Championships.](http://www.bellyboarding.co.uk/)

**3\. Nature**  
Cornwall is not just sandy beaches, it has many other areas of [outstanding natural beauty](https://www.visitcornwall.com/things-to-do/active-and-outdoors/aonb) such as Bodmin Moor and the Tamar Valley. You are never stuck for somewhere to go for a stunning walk.

**4\. The food**  
We are spoilt for choice when it comes to outstanding cuisine. Cornwall is home to some excellent chefs like Rick Stein, Paul Ainsworth and Nathan Outlaw. It has some fantastic restaurants like Jamie Oliver’s [Fifteen Cornwall](https://www.fifteencornwall.co.uk/restaurant/), [The Gurnards Head](http://www.gurnardshead.co.uk/) and [The Dining Room](http://www.thediningroomrock.co.uk/).  
Cornwall is also home to some excellent breweries like [Sharps](https://www.sharpsbrewery.co.uk/), [Skinners](http://www.skinnersbrewery.com/) and [St Austell](http://www.staustellbrewery.co.uk/).  [Camel Valley](https://www.camelvalley.com/)  make some fantastic wines and don’t forget the pasties and cream teas! Jam first obviously.

**5\. The traffic**  
Asides from the dreaded Chiverton roundabout, you rarely get stuck in traffic on your daily commute to work however this does change during the summer holiday. Occasionally I do get stuck behind a tractor or even a flock of sheep but this is much more amusing than another signal failure on the District Line.

**6\. The Culture**  
There are some fantastic theatre companies based in Cornwall, [Kneehigh](http://www.kneehigh.co.uk/) and [Miracle](http://www.miracletheatre.co.uk/), for example.  The [Minack Theatre](https://www.minack.com/) is just breathtaking. Cornwall is also home to some fantastic music festivals such as [Port Elliott](http://www.porteliotfestival.com/) and [Boardmasters](http://www.boardmasters.co.uk/).

**7\. The Art**  
Cornwall is famous for it’s exquisite art, St Ives in particular has drawn artists from all over the world for centuries. It is still full of fantastic artists, [galleries](http://www.stives-cornwall.co.uk/about-our-town/the-galleries/) and museums. A perfect place to spend your spare time getting lost in.

**8\. The Community**  
Cornwall can feel like a giant village – everybody knows each other! But this can be a good thing. People are really very friendly, welcoming and inclusive. This is just as true in the business world as it is in your local village.

**9\. Super Fast Broadband**  
Cornwall has super fast connectivity which means that you can work on a global scale whilst being based in a place often referred to as the British Silicon Valley.

**10\. Entrepreneurial spirit**  
Cornwall has one of the highest rates of  start-up businesses in the UK. These start ups also have the highest survival rate after 3 years! There is a lot of support and business networks out there – people are passionate about knowledge transfer and I am sure that plays a big part in the success of the county.
