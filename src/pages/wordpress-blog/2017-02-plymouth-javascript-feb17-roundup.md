PlymouthJS is an informal tech meetup based in the centre of Plymouth. What started out as a small gathering of software enthusiasts, quickly transformed into a popular South West event for developers of all skill levels with a shared objective: to learn and share their experiences with JavaScript frameworks.

The evening began with a warm welcome from the event organiser, [Andy Mantell](https://twitter.com/andymantell) – senior Front End developer for [@LandRegGov](https://twitter.com/LandRegGov).

Andy thanked everybody for attending. There was also a mention to Headforwards for sponsoring the event with our famed Ale “BDD” – {Beer Driven Development} and copious amounts of pizza.

**Welcome / Opening**

_Toby Parkins – [@headforwards](https://twitter.com/Headforwards)_

Toby kicked off the evening by walking through some of our internal development processes. He also gave us a look at some of the projects currently underway here at HF and the JS frameworks we regularly use.

Following on after the talk, a few developers were interested in the Agile processes used, and how their own teams can deploy similar methods. There was also discussion regarding our use of version control systems and how we minimise complex branching and forking to avoid future dependency issues.

**Let’s Go TypScript!**

_Rob Mitchell – [@Vualto](https://twitter.com/Vualto)_

Rob provided an inside look at the methodology used behind TypeScript and how he implements it into his own projects. He covered the benefits of TS but also shared the downsides of the language including when not to use it.

There were plenty of questions after Rob’s session, primarily discussing the transition from JavaScript to TypeScript. This led to a really great back and forth discussing the many benefits of using TS to increase workflow efficiency.

**Intro into ReactJS**

_Gerrit Neven ([@gerbyzation](https://twitter.com/gerbyzation))_

Gerrit has been working with ReactJS on a few of his recent projects and wanted to talk about how this framework can be used in various and interesting ways. His main focus was on the way React has the ability to update specific modules within a program to maximise efficiency.

[ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is a programming language written by Facebook for many of the web and mobile app interfaces used every day by millions of people.

The meet up felt really positive with plenty of interesting discussions to get involved in. A huge thank you goes to out to the speakers for sharing their adventures with JavaScript frameworks. If you are interested in participating in the next tech meet up, [follow PlymJS](https://twitter.com/PlymouthJS) on twitter regarding forthcoming events.

We would also like to thank THINQTANQ and Andy Mantell for organising and hosting the event.
