Earlier today the [shortlist](https://www.businesscornwall.co.uk/news-by-industry/awards/2016/04/cornwall-business-awards-finalists-2/) for the 2016 Cornwall Business Awards was announced, and we are thrilled to say that we are shortlisted for the Employer of The Year Award.

The prestigious evening event shines a spotlight on the amazing business people who help drive the Cornish economy and make it one of the best places in the country to do business.
