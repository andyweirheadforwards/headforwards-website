Every year to mark the end of the summer and to celebrate the teams hard work, Headforwards organise a festival called Headstock.

September 2013 was no different  and the mini festival was held on the beautiful [Roseland Peninsular](http://www.roselandpeninsula.com/).

A lot of work goes into planning the weekend which is filled with live music, BBQs, Kayaking and even a bouncy castle!

No outdoor event would be complete without a beautiful bonfire and spectacular fireworks display.

The team and their families look forward to Headstock every year, it really is the perfect way to end the summer.
