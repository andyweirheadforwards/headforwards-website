We do love to get together and enjoy our Cornish surroundings.

So in mid July we all got together for another summer BBQ on the beach. This time we chose [Trevaunance Cove](http://www.cornwall-online.co.uk/carrick/stagnes-trevaunancecove.asp) in [St Agnes](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/st-agnes-and-chapel-porth/), which is a local favourite of ours.

We were also lucky enough to be treated to a guided Kayak tour of the coastline including its caves by the wonderful [Koru Kayaking](http://korukayaking.co.uk/). If you get the chance to go on one of their spectacular guided kayaking tours you really should. They are honestly something special.

Here are a few photos from the evening, if you want to watch them in a slideshow please just click on one image and it will open up.
