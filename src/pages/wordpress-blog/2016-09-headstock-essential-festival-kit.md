So the festival feeling is beginning to flicker as our annual summer get together, HeadStock, draws ever closer.

We at Headforwards are looking forward to letting our hair down, after what has been another hard working summer! This Headstock essential festival kit guide should help you plan out your weekend away.

This years festival promises to be just like previous years.. Except it’s been on a course of Russian athlete standard steroids and is an entirely different beast altogether.

We have a plethora of bands performing for us, as well as a sumptuous BBQ and a fine selection of cask ales. The venue has changed somewhat into a slightly larger space in order to accommodate all of our extra curricular activities!

This years event is at The Quarry in St Agnes.

In order to gain maximum enjoyment out of the weekend’s celebrations I advise you all to adhere to this definitive list of essential festival kit:

**1\.   Sleeping quarters.** Camping is the norm so a sturdy (yet stylish) tent is the recommended option.

Alternatively there will be parking available for those who wish to stay in their vehicles (Vans, campervans etc).

**2\. Essential extras. **Bringing a handheld torch is advised as the terrain is uneven in places therefore it will make the trip back to your sleeping quarters a little less hazardous!

Also a fold up chair for you to sit and relax on during the day wouldn’t go amiss.

**3\.  Bedding. **Sleeping bags are a must as well as a pillow and roll mat. Those who are used to camping in style will already have dusted off their airbed’s, these people mean business!

**4. ****Food and Drink. **Whilst we provide some food and drink, do not rely on this as your staple diet for the weekend. Please bring your own food and beverages to keep yourselves topped up during the weekend’s antics.

Fun snacks will be crucial to maintaining your optimal party level:

Cereal bars, wraps, sandwiches, sausage rolls, pork pies, dried fruit, multipacks (crisps and chocolate bars), homemade granola/flapjacks, bagels, jaffa cakes etc.

**5\. Warm/Spare clothes.** It can get fairly chilly in the evenings so warm clothing is a must. Also be sure to bring a combination of wet weather gear and hot summer gear.

This Cornish weather can be temperamental at the best of times! Spare socks and pants should be high up the list.

**6\. Footwear.** Critical bits of kit here people. Conditions down at the Quarry can get a bit muddy so bring your wellies! We strongly recommend sensible and supportive footwear.

**7. Hygiene maintenance items. **Intense boogy’ing requires your own stash of wet wipes and deodorant. Also recommended are the following items:

Personal medications (plus extra)

Sun Cream

Anti-bacterial handwash

**8\. Exciting extras. **Glitter. Themed clothing. Handheld fans. Water pistol. Face paint. Headbands. Cuddly toy. These extras are sure to make you stand out from the crowd!

**THEME: After weeks of careful deliberation, various meetings and time consuming research, the Headstock committee decided that the theme for this years Headstock is…… RAINBOW. This is purposefully broad to allow for lots of creativity. There best dressed person will receive a top quality prize. Get Creative!**

This promises to be a fantastic weekend, well done everyone, you’ve earned it!
