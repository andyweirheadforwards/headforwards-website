We decided to celebrate the arrival of Spring with an evening out at the [Wheelhouse Crab and Oyster](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186235-d1734677-Reviews-The_Wheel_House-Falmouth_Cornwall_England.html) bar  in [Falmouth.](http://www.falmouth.co.uk/)

The [Wheelhouse](http://www.cornishguardian.co.uk/Lee-Trewhela-ruins-Wheelhouse-s-word-mouth-rule/story-15243269-detail/story.html) is really rather special, offering the freshest seafood that is caught locally that day. They don’t have a website, nor do they have social media accounts yet they are rated the number 1 restaurant in Falmouth according to Trip Adviser.

So, after work one day we decided to make the short trip to Falmouth to experience some rather perfect food.  We were not disappointed!

The food was spectacular, as was the company!

After dinner we visited [Beerwolf Books](http://beerwolfbooks.com/), another Falmouth favourite.

We all had a fantastic evening, and we are looking forward to the next one!
