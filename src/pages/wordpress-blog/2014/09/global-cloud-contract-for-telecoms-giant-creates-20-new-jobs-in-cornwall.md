Cornwall’s fastest growing technology start-up company has won a global cloud contract for telecom giant NTT Communications which will create 20 new technology jobs.

Headforwards, a three-year old software outsourcing company based in Pool Innovation Centre, secured the contract with one of the world’s largest telecoms companies to work on the Next Generation Cloud Platform.

The news was announced today by the Rt Hon Secretary of State for Business Innovation and Skills, Dr Vince Cable MP, during his visit to Cornwall.

Toby Parkins, director of Headforwards and President of the Cornwall Chamber of Commerce, said: “The contract means a lot of things for us. We will become a medium sized enterprise employing 58 people, our business is attracting world class developers who are attracted by the sun, sea and fibre connectivity that Cornwall has to offer and it shows that our corporate values – Great Software, Inspired Engineers and Happy Clients – continues to deliver for us.”

Co-Director of Headforwards, Craig Girvan, added: “The size and rate of our growth means we are working with a number of universities and colleges to help shape the future design of courses. Large corporate companies want highly skilled people so we must ensure our universities are producing the right calibre of graduate equipped with the right skills so we can continue to attract investment and expansion.”

The new employees will include a range of programmers and technology specialists from Cornwall and across the globe.  
Julian Beer, Pro-Vice Chancellor of Plymouth University, said: “I am delighted to hear of the further success of Headforwards and I am pleased that two university-led GAIN services – the innovation centres and Cornwall Enterprise Programme – have played their part in supporting Toby and his team.

“The university remains committed to supporting the growth of the emerging Cornish software industry and is working closely with businesses and its partner colleges to continually develop its computing courses so that a new stream of qualified staff are available. ”

Sandra Rothwell, chief executive of the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Local Enterprise Partnership, said: “These are high quality, high-tech jobs and exactly the sort of employment we want to see in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, building on our existing strengths including the availability of superfast fibre broadband.

“The LEP is committed to supporting Cornwall’s emerging software sector and this announcement is a good indicator of its growing strength and ability to create high-value jobs.”
