We are really excited to announce the line up for our Software Squad event!

First we have [Toby Parkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobyparkins) who is a director here at [Headforwards](http://www.headforwards.com/who-we-are/) as well as at [Agile on the Beach](http://agileonthebeach.com/), [Pixxcell Ltd](http://www.pixxcell.com/stories) and [UK Net Web](https://www.uknetweb.com/). He is also a board member at [Cornwall Chamber](http://www.cornwallchamber.co.uk/). Toby will be facilitating a hands-on-learning workshop that teaches the delegates code.

We then have Caroline Cripps who is the program manager of the [new computing degree ](https://www.cornwall.ac.uk/courses/bsc-hons-computing-technologies-top) at [Cornwall College](https://www.cornwall.ac.uk/). This is the degree that [Software Cornwall ](http://www.softwarecornwall.org/cornish-software-industry-shapes-degree-offer/) helped to design. Caroline will be talking to the delegates about Higher Education options here in Cornwall.

[Jimmy Headdon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimmyheaddon) is the next speaker in the line up. He is Senior Software Engineer at [McLaren Racing](http://www.mclaren.com/formula1/).  He is planning to talk about his journey from growing up in Cornwall to getting where he is today- and of course fast cars!

[Daphne Skinnard](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/daphne-skinnard/12/900/953) is Assistant Editor at the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/) and she is looking forward to talking to the students about the important role technology and software play in the media.

Ending the day we have  [Sam Lanyon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conceptshed) who is a Director at [Concept Shed](http://www.conceptshed.com/) – a disruptive innovation and design consultancy based in Falmouth. You may have seen his [AutoWed](http://www.conceptshed.com/projects/autowed-wedding-machine/) creation on [Dragons Den.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006vq92)

The free event is being held at [Pool Innovation Centre](http://www.cornwallinnovation.co.uk/pool-innovation-centre) on 11th August 2015.  A handful of tickets are still available if you wish to attend, but be quick! You can book them through [Event Brite](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/headforwards-software-squad-tickets-17692901946?aff=ehomesaved).
