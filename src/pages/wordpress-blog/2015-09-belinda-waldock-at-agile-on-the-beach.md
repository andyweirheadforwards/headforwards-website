[Lyssa](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/lyssafeecrump), _our Marketing Manager, has written the following article about_ _Belinda Waldock at Agile on the Beach and her talk entitled “Being Agile in Business”_

[Belinda Waldock](https://twitter.com/belindawaldock) is an Agile business coach who has spent the last 15 years working with SME’s in the South West supporting ICT adoption, and for the last 5 years has been specialising in agile business management.

She is on the [Agile on the Beach](http://agileonthebeach.com/) committee and is also a big supporter of [Software Cornwall](http://www.headforwards.com/2015/08/software-cornwall/), a collective of software companies who are committed to raising its profile in the county.

Waldock talks about doing business in an Agile way.

Agile thinking.  
Agile approach.  
Agile culture.

Agile is not just for the software world, the skills and benefits are definitely transferable.

If we look at the Agile manifesto and replace the word software with solutions it still makes perfect sense.

“Working solutions _over _comprehensive documentation”

She makes the remark “_Common sense isn’t very common any more_” and I think that is something most of us could attest to.

Agile thinking helps lead us back to a place where common sense is prevalent.

She has recently had a book published called “[Being Agile in Business](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Being-Agile-Business-Discover-Smarter/dp/1292083700/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=wwwbelindawco-21&linkCode=w00&linkId=ARFOGQWJ52CULALO&creativeASIN=1292083700)”

It was really interesting to hear about Waldocks unusual approach to writing this book.  
The publishers loved the idea and asked her to go away for 6 months to write it. They would then review what she had written and, more than likely, tear it apart and send her off for another 6 months to rewrite it.

To Waldock this seemed like a very counter productive way to write a book-not very agile.  
She spoke to her publishers and proposed writing it in sprints.  
After some initial trepidation they agreed.

She made a Kanban board and included all the topics she wanted to cover. She then covered one section per sprint, and sent it to the publishers to be approved.

The book was written in just 16 short weeks and came in on time and on budget.  
The publishers were thrilled and now see the value of writing in an agile way.  
I believe they are now even encouraging other writers to try the agile approach.

Waldock also discussed the agile journey of some of the other businesses she has coached and mentored.

I found one tool she used particularly interesting, it is an adaptation of the speed boat exercise.  
A boat is drawn on the board, and the task post-its are placed on it.  
If a task was placed by the anchor it was because the task was dragging them down, if it was placed by the sails it was because it was the wind in their wings.

This is a really useful exercise for gauging the teams happiness levels as well their work load and helping with prioritisation.

Belinda Waldock at Agile on the Beach had a strong message: Be Agile- don’t worry about being perfect.

I know this is something I personally struggle with, and I know that my strive for perfection can hinder or delay projects.  
I guess the software equivalent to this would be minimum viable product. (MVP)

Waldock does go on to stress the point that it is important to make a plan, just be prepared for that plan to change.  
You need to be flexible and ready to adjust.

She goes on to say Agile isn’t necessarily the solution, but it is a way of showing you where the problems are and helping you to fix them.

It is clear to me there are many benefits to embracing an agile approach in all areas of your business. It is an approach I have been taking for a number of years, however Waldock has inspired me to take it a step further than I have been.

To try to be more agile, and worry less about it being perfect.
