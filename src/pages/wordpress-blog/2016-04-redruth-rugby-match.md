Headforwards were pleased to be sponsoring a Redruth rugby match on Saturday 16th April.  
The Headforwards team, along with some guests, spent the game in the  Tribute lounge with some fantastic food and drink along with an excellent view of the match.  
It was a thrilling game and everyone enjoyed watching it – even the members of the team who are new to rugby!

Thank you to everyone who came along and made the day so special. We are all already looking forward to the next Redruth rugby match.
