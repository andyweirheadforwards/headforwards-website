We are pleased to announce the imminent merger between [Headforwards](https://www.headforwards.com/) and [UKNetWeb](https://www.uknetweb.com/).

Until now Headforwards have specialised in larger, long-term outsource software projects.  
On these projects dedicated teams of developers are recruited for their clients offering them a continuous, dedicated resource. UKNetWeb compliments this as they offer shorter term, high quality solutions on a per project basis.

This new union means Headforwards can now offer shorter term, one off projects, as well as the dedicated teams for continuous development, to all their existing partners as well as new clients.

The fresh new offering will include creation of advanced e-commerce websites, cloud applications as well as long-term software projects.

“_This new merger means great things for Headforwards.  
We are now able to offer our clients a more well rounded software package, allowing us to provide the right solution for them.  
We have seen a rise in demand for these shorter projects from local firms, and we are pleased that our new Special Projects Division will be able to meet this demand. ”_

Toby Parkins  
Director  
Headforwards Solutions LTD

Combined, the companies already have an impressive client list consisting of a variety of local businesses along with larger national and international companies including John Lewis, NTT and AXA PPP Healthcare.

The newly merged company will continue to trade under Headforwards, but UKNetWeb will be heading up the new Special Projects Divison.

Headforwards recently announced they had 42 new jobs available, so if you are interested in becoming part of one of the fastest growing tech companies in the south west, it would seem now is the time.
