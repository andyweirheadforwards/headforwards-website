**WHY CORNWALL?**

Cornwall over the last few years has now become an unlikely high tech hub. The UK government’s 2016 [Tech Nation report](http://www.techcityuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Tech-Nation-2016_FINAL-ONLINE-1.pdf) states that Cornwall is the second fastest growing tech economy. This is due to turnover increasing by 153% between 2010 and 2014.

Living and working in Cornwall as part of the tech community is an exciting place to be. [Superfast Broadband](https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/council-news-room/media-releases/news-from-2015/news-from-june-2015/new-multi-million-pound-deal-will-make-superfast-broadband-available-to-thousands-more-cornish-homes-and-businesses/) is now installed county wide. This means that Cornwall is now very well connected which allows businesses to communicate faster than ever. As a result, Cornwall is now a hotbed for [Tech activity in the UK](http://www.investincornwall.com/key-sectors/tech-and-creative/).

As mentioned previously, Cornwall is perfect for those who wish to find adventure [outside of the office](http://www.cornwalls.co.uk/top_ten). There is a surplus of stunning beaches and acres of beautiful countryside, that won’t leave you stuck for things to do.

Here at Headforwards during the summer months we aim to get out onto the beach and partake in activities such as surfing and kayaking. Building relationships with people is at the heart of all we do and the more personable we can be, the better. Having the ability to communicate well with both colleagues and clients is an essential part of working for Headforwards.
