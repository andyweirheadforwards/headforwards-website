_[Unlocking Potential](http://www.unlocking-potential.co.uk/) are passionate about helping people and business grow in Cornwall._  
_They recently published a blog article [Unlocking Potential: Cornwall’s Tech Revolution](http://www.unlocking-potential.co.uk/blog/cornwalls-tech-revolution) that features Headforwards and co-founder Toby Parkins. You can read the full article below – or on their website. _

Toby Parkins, co-founder and director of software outsourcing company [Headforwards](https://www.headforwards.com/), tells us about his business journey and the advent of the Tech revolution in Cornwall.

According to the 2016 Tech Nation Report, Cornwall’s digital economy is thriving: Ranked second in the UK (with a 153% increase in turnover growth) it is outstripping even the Nation’s Capital.

Toby Parkins is widely recognised as a leading figure in this tech revolution. As founding director of UKNetWeb and co-founder of Headforwards he is positioned firmly at the core of growth in this sector. His broader roles as President of Cornwall Chamber of Commerce and as a director of Software Cornwall, allow him to champion Cornwall as a growth hub.

Headforwards grew from a shared passion for Agile methodologies and Agile software development between Toby and co-founder Craig Girvan. A chance discussion about the possibility of starting a larger scale, outsource, software development team grew wings and the business was launched in 2011 with a small team, one client and a growth plan. Five years on they employ sixty people, are currently recruiting and aim to grow to around 250 employees over the next five years.

Cornwall might seem like an unlikely hub for a tech revolution; it is perceived to be geographically isolated and is known more for its tourism opportunities. However, the introduction of Superfast Broadband into the county in 2011 has had a tremendous impact and 95% of Cornish businesses now have access to Superfast internet speeds.

The tech industries depend fundamentally on people and on skills.

Attracting the right people with the right skills becomes easier when you are bringing those people, and their families, to live and work in Cornwall. Work/Life balance is extremely important at Headforwards and company BBQs on the beach are a regular feature of the working week.

The geographical location has also helped with the formation of Agile on the Beach, an annual business and technology conference which attracts 350 local, national and international delegates each year to Cornwall’s shores.

Tech jobs in Cornwall are also very well-paid when compared to general wages in the County. The average salary in this sector, as determined from advertised vacancies, is £34,367 which is almost twice the current average salary in Cornwall as a whole (£17,340). At Headforwards everyone is paid well above the County average, in fact it is comparable to most industry standards, and when cost of living is taken into account, their developers tend to have a more of disposable income compared to their London counterparts.

Finding the right skills is more of a challenge but it is fair to say that this is a worldwide challenge. Toby originally trained and worked as a maths teacher so he understands the challenges teachers face but he is passionate about working with educators to develop better skills development in Cornwall. Software Cornwall works with education providers and new courses have been developed with the colleges which better meet the need of tech industries.  
Moving forward, there are lots of opportunities for Cornwall to continue as a growth hub. The media likes to call Cornwall the next Silicon Valley but actually, Cornwall has a significant advantage over that large, factory style system. Cornish tech businesses tend, on the whole, to be SMEs. This allows greater flexibility and, indeed, Agility. There is an unusually high level of collaboration in the county and tech businesses work well together often servicing the same clients in a seamless interaction. Software Cornwall grew as a direct result of existing collaboration and in order to aid further networking and growth.

As a prime example of the benefits of collaboration, there is such synergy between UKNetWeb and Headforwards that Toby and Craig have decided to merge the two businesses and UKNetWeb will become the Special Projects wing of its sister company, allowing greater flexibility for both teams.

Toby is currently driving forward plans to develop a Fibre Park Academy in Cornwall to provide better tech specific educational opportunities as well as work space for around 500 people, allowing smaller businesses to connect and collaborate more easily. The Fibre Park would operate as a hub with a Hyperfast 100Gbps digital ring connecting it to other key sites around the county.

It would be a mistake to think that there are no problems on the horizon. Cornwall is geographically isolated and business does still require face to face meetings with people across the UK and beyond so the maintenance and development of a strong transport system is critical to continued growth.  
It is too early to predict all the possible threats and opportunities that Britain’s exit from the EU will bring to the sector but Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly are the focus of European Economic Regeneration Programme which had a funding budget of over €600m for the period 2014-2020 and the region cannot help but be damaged by its loss.

However, pre-Brexit UK tech was predicted to grow by 60% by 2025. Cornwall has shown a 60% increase in four years (2009-2013) compared to a national increase of 15%. If those figures are extrapolated out we could still be looking at a sector increase in the region of 250% by 2025.  
Whatever the challenges ahead the Cornish tech sector will continue to provide flexible, Agile tech solutions for a growing, worldwide clientele.
