Welcome to 2016! We hope you all had a fantastic Christmas and New Year?

Here at Headforwards, we are constantly striving for agile excellence and as you know a key part of being agile is having regular retrospectives. We have just been looking back on the past twelve months and decided to share with you a quick review of Headforwards in 2015.

In this past year our team of hardworking software professionals has grown from 55 to 63.  That is an increase of nearly 15%!  
It has been great getting to know the new members of the team and we have all been benefitting from their expertise and knowledge.

It is a really exciting time at Headforwards as we are welcoming new clients and recruiting more talented team members. We are expecting to welcome another 5 members to the team within the next month or so, which is fantastic.

Some highlights for Headforwards in 2015 were:

[Software Squad  
](http://www.headforwards.com/2015/08/software-squad-event-august-2015/)  
This was an event we ran in August where we welcomed young IT enthusiasts to Headforwards HQ for an exciting software day. We had a lot of fun facilitating coding workshops where the students got to try their hands at Pair Programming on Raspberry Pi’s. We were also lucky enough to have a range of industry professionals (including people from the BBC and Maclaren Racing) come in to discuss their career paths and opportunities available.

This is our end of summer festival that we held on the Roseland peninsula in September.  
It is a celebration where the whole team and our families get together to have some well earned fun!  
We were so lucky with the weather this year, it was perfect for camping! Over the course of the weekend we were treated to some great live music, fantastic food and even bouncy castles!

[Agile on the Beach](http://www.headforwards.com/2015/09/headforwards-at-agile-on-the-beach/)

This is one of the best agile conferences in the world and it is held down the road in Falmouth. We always enjoy attending as we find it informative and inspirational. This year Headforwards directors Toby Parkins and Craig Girvan were invited to talk. They used this opportunity to announce and welcome collaboration on their Open Agile Profiler (OAP).

2015 was an amazing year for us at Headforwards.  
We got to make excellent software with a talented team of people, whilst partnering with exciting clients.  
We are looking forward to seeing what 2016 holds for us and we hope you are too.

If you are interested in becoming part of the team here at Headforwards, please take a look at our [Careers Page.](http://www.headforwards.com/careers/) We are currently have a number of positions open including Web Designer, iOS App Developer and Perl Developer.
