We are really pleased to hear the [Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-fleet-of-trains-to-bring-better-journeys-to-the-south-west) has given the go ahead for a new rail deal for Cornwall.

  
This means that [First Great Western](https://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/) are now able to buy 29 new state of the art, long distance trains that will be in service from 2018.  
They are being purchased from Hitachi Rail Europe for £360 Million and will replaces the 40 year old trains that are being used at the moment.

[Claire Perry](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/claire-perry), Rail Minister, said

_“This industry initiative goes hand-in-hand with the work this Government is doing to reverse decades of underinvestment in transport infrastructure in regions like the South West.”_

The great news is these new trains will have an increase of up to 24%  in capacity resulting in 1000 additional seats during peak times at [Paddington.  
](http://www.networkrail.co.uk/london-paddington-station/departures-arrivals/)  
It will also cut the London to Penzance travel time down by 15 minutes, and as we know; on a business commute every minute counts.

This is great news for the millions of people who frequently travel from Cornwall to London for business and it will ultimately help economic growth across Cornwall. It will be interesting to see the impact these new trains have on the economy.

We have previously addressed the best ways to do the London to Cornwall journey, take a look at our [Travelling to Cornwall](http://www.headforwards.com/2015/06/travelling-to-cornwall/) article for more information on travelling by train.

The fact that the new trains are bi-modes (meaning they are able to work on electric and diesel) ensures that they are future proof. They will have bigger fuel tanks and more powerful engines enabling them to cope with the geographical challenges of the Westcountry in a more effcient way.

[Karen Boswell](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/karen-boswell/a4/b0a/294), Managing Director of [Hitachi Rail Europe](http://www.hitachirail-eu.com/) said the announcement

_“builds on our significant and sustained investment in the British Rail Sector. This contract with First Great Western recognises the quality of Hitachi’s high speed trains and our world class engineering capability. Hitachi Rail Europe is committed to delivering trains for the UK’s fare-paying customers that are genuinely transformative in terms of speed, capacity and comfort. This new fleet will be a revolution in customer experience for those travelling to and from the south west, and we look forward to delivering Hitachi trains for use from 2018. Between 2014 and 2019, more than £38 billion is being invested in improving and maintaining the rail network across the country.”_

We even hear that there will be upgrades to the [sleeper service](http://www.seat61.com/Cornwall-sleeper.htm#.VbuNqJNVhBc), which is one of our favourite ways to travel to London for an early morning meeting.

What are your thoughts on the new trains? Are you counting down the days until they arrive, or do you not think it will make much difference?
