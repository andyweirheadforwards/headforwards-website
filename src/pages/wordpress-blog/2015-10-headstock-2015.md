Here at Headforwards we like to mark the end of summer with a mini festival we affectionately call Headstock.

Nick, one of our team members, kindly lets us use his families land on the [Roseland](http://www.roselandpeninsula.com/).  
So for one weekend a year, Headforwards along with their family and friends pitch up there for a few days of fun, music and letting our hair down.  
Karen from our Recruitment Department puts in a lot of effort to ensure that we all have a fantastic weekend- thank you Karen you really excelled yourself this year.

We held Headstock a little later this year on the last weekend in September, but we were still extremely lucky with the weather. It was truly glorious.

We hired two bouncy castles for the kids (and the big kids) as well as setting up a games championship involving Swing Ball, Horseshoes and Badminton.  
The Fire pit was a fantastic edition that kept us all warm in the evenings as well as adding to the festival atmosphere.

True to form, we did some serious BBQ’ing, the kids also got involved by toasting marshmallows on the smaller BBQ.

As we were set up on the river bank we were able to do lots of kayaking and playing about on the water, which was excellent fun.

On Saturday afternoon we had some lovely, chilled live music from [Let’s Duet](http://www.freakmusic.co.uk/bands/lets_duet#.Vg0soRNVhBd). They were the perfect accompaniment for a chilled afternoon next to a river.

A lot of people at Headforwards are excited about the Rugby World Cup, so we set up a projector so we could all watch the important England match.

When darkness hit we were treated to a spectacular fireworks display, and the kids got to run around with glowsticks and sparklers.

In the morning we saw lots of Pheasants and wild Deer running around in the fields, as well as a lot of noisy Canada Geese.

This years little thank you festival was a great success and really a lot of fun.  
It is really important to us that we get to spend time together out of work, getting to know each other better as it leads to us being a more effective team.

It is also important to us that we reward the team for all their hard work, and being based in Cornwall enables us to do that in some truly spectacular places.  
Please take a look at the photos of the weekend and let us know what you think.
