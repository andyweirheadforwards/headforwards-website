Software Cornwall was [established in 2015](https://www.softwarecornwall.org/about-us/) to connect South West based like-minded businesses to achieve a shared goal of promoting technology growth within Cornwall. After the hugely successful debut event in 2016, a decision was made to host a full-day 2017 tech event fully-loaded with talks, workshops, exhibitors and ample time between talks for delegates to connect and share knowledge.

122 delegates in total attended SCBCE17 with a high percentage of non-members visiting for the first time. Seeing such a large volume of first-time visitors is something we’re really excited about. It shows us that local business owners are realising the potential of sharing their knowledge with others while at the same time, achieving a shared goal of promoting Cornwall as a leading tech hub for the UK.

“Our aim is to foster a thriving Open data community in Cornwall, focusing on how open data can be developed and used to engender economic and social innovation and prosperity as part of the digital economy…”
