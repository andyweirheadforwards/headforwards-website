The finalists for the Western Morning News Business Awards 2017 have just been [announced](http://www.devonlive.com/news/business/revealed-shortlist-western-morning-news-612098) and we are thrilled to have been shortlisted for two awards.

A wide range of businesses in different sectors from the Isles of Scilly to the Somerset border is represented in the finalists.

Bill Martin, editor of the Western Morning News said:

_“This year’s entries were again outstanding illustrating that, despite the challenges of the environment we work in, there’s a real appetite for excellence in the region – and a real desire to let the rest of the country know._

_“The challenges provided by our geography, and our chronically underfunded infrastructure, have been exacerbated by uncertainty around Brexit. _

_“It is at times like this that leadership really counts. That is why it is heartening to see so many businesses in the region that are not only flourishing, but they are doing so with confidence and clarity.”_

We are shortlisted for **Business of the Year** and **Best Technological or Creative Business **alongside some fantastic businesses.

We are looking forward to celebrating with all the other finalists at the gala dinner at St Mellion on Thursday 16th November.
