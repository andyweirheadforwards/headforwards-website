We love our team socials here at Headforwards and at the end of every summer, we put on an outdoor event, called Headstock, for the whole team, our families and our friends. Each year has been slightly different, but the core requirements remain the same: music, BBQs, bouncy castles, beer and an incredible group of people to enjoy it.

We took Headstock 2017 to a new location at [Stithians Lake](https://www.southwestlakes.co.uk/location/stithians-lake/). This meant on top of the usual offerings, we were able to have a go at kayaking or paddle boarding for a few hours in the afternoon.

Reggae music throughout the afternoon from [Konquerin' Sounds](https://www.facebook.com/konquerin.soundz) brought a sunny vibe despite the weather and was a great backdrop to a few beers and some great BBQ food - big thanks to Toby and Karen for manning the BBQ the whole day and to the [Driftwood Spars Brewery](https://www.driftwoodsparsbrewery.com/) for making such great beer!

Alongside the watersports, we had bouncy castles and a cinema tent - for those that didn't want to brave the lake and as a way to warm up afterwards. The cinema was run by the [Cornwall Film festival](http://cornwallfilmfestival.com/) crew and they even provided popcorn.

Before the sun went down we managed to fit in a couple of hours of outdoor laser tag - not just for the kids. There's a group of us here at Headforwards that try and go every week - we're current champions of the [Lungfish Cup](https://radix-communications.com/lungfish-cup-raise-cash-bbc-children-need/)!

As the evening progressed we stood around fire pits with marshmallows and a few more beers and were treated to some great tunes by Joe Francis of [Winter Mountain](https://www.facebook.com/wintermountain/) followed by Glass Off - another great local trio.

Unfortunately, the September sunshine we hope for every year didn't show its face, but despite the weather, we all had a lot of fun. Huge thanks to everyone who helped with the set-up and clear-down, and of course to everyone who braved the weather to join us.

If you want to check out what else we've been up to recently take a look at our [Team Adventures page](https://www.headforwards.com/category/team-adventures/)

"The entertainments laid on were excellent and family all had a really good time - pretty good keeping 3 kids occupied over 7 hours! Would definitely go again."

"I could take my dog! :) In all seriousness, I took my brother, niece and my dog. It was a real family feel with things for the adults, the kids and other dogs too! I went Kayaking (not with the dog) drank G&Ts, ate burgers and listened to great bands. Really enjoyable day!"

"Nice atmosphere. Well planned with tents, fire, hay bales etc. The music is always a highlight. Location was, again, excellent as well."
