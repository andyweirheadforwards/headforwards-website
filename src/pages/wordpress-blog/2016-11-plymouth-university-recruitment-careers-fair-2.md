In early November, Alex from our recruitment team headed up the A30 for the Plymouth University recruitment careers fair. He was joined by two other members from [Software Cornwall](https://www.softwarecornwall.org/); Paul Clark from Packet Ship and Steve Forth from Bluefruit.

The day was a great opportunity for businesses such as ourselves to get a feel for what the current crop of students are up to on their University courses. The day proved be very productive!

Before we had a chance to set up, there was a large group of students waiting for us to open our stand. They then picked our brains about what we had to offer them.

It was fantastic to learn about what languages and frameworks the students were using. This gives us a good idea of how well the students will adapt to life as a potential [Headforwards employee](https://www.headforwards.com/our-values/)!

It was very interesting to hear what projects the students were currently working on, both inside and outside of lectures. All of them seemed determined to secure tech jobs with companies in the South West.

Establishing a strong connection with Plymouth University students and graduates is something we value very highly.

One of the main highlights of the day was being able to get the students to become members of Software Cornwall. ( membership for students is free!). By doing so, it allows them to have access to a vast quantity of events and company information.

As a result, the students are handed the opportunity to get involved with real life projects and companies outside of their degree.

This is something that we highly recommend to all students we meet.

When the day drew to a close we were still in discussion with many students. Alex, Paul and Steve were all in agreement that the day was a success.

Many students left our stand with a clearer knowledge of the opportunities that exist on the opposite side of the Tamar.

If you are a student or graduate and would like to have a look at our current open job roles,  please have a look at our [careers page](https://www.headforwards.com/careers/). You can find out all you need to know about our expected criteria for our job roles there.

Finally, we would like to extend our gratitude to the team at Plymouth University who made the day so enjoyable. Next years Plymouth University recruitment careers fair is already in our diaries!
