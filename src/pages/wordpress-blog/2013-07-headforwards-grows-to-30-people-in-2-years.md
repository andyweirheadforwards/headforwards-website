In only 2  short years the Cornwall based software outsourcing company Headforwards has grown to 30 employees making it one of the fastest growing startups in the southwest of the UK.

Further contracts are continually being negotiated and then signed to increase its capacity further and the next 2 years are set to present a potential golden opportunity as the company starts to diversify into other specialist software development areas.

“_Our targets set us to grow by a further 200% in the next 2 years although I would be equally satisfied to double in size in that time._” commented Toby Parkins, “_We have to be realistic with regard to exactly how quickly growth can occur. We’ve been lucky due to lots of skilled people wanting to either remain living in Cornwall, or wishing to return or relocate to the area, and we certainly hope this will continue_”.

Part of the company’s long term strategy is to redefine the UK market place for software development through a combination approach of improvement in education, training and skills as well as enabling an improved professional IT community in Cornwall.

“_I have a long term strategy to drive forward more quality office space in Cornwall, to increase actually useful skills and training and to carry out activities that make the rest of the world want to talk about us. I’d like to see every single school child being given the opportunity to learn a computer language. This single objective would dramatically change the economic outlook of the Duchy and the career prospects for many young people within 6 years_.”

HeadForwards is based in the new Pool Innovation Centre near Redruth, Cornwall, which boasts superfast fibre connectivity and was completed in 2010 with the help of the EU Convergence Fund.

They are currently offering jobs in Cornwall to over 30 people, and are still recruiting. To see if they have the right opportunity for you, please look at their [careers](http://www.headforwards.com/careers/) page.
