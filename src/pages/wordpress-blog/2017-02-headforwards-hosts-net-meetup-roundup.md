Due to the success of recent developer events, we scheduled our first ever .NET social meetup. The event location was at our HQ in Redruth. The objective: establish a plan of action for future events. Armed with post-it notes and sharpies, topics soon emerged on the white-board.

The main talking point centred around the new(ish) kid on the block: ASP.NET Core. It’s the first major open-source framework of its kind which, for a closed ecosystem, is exciting news. The framework is a total re-write of ASP.NET 4.6 and runs side by side to closed-source counterpart. This gives developers some new and exciting opportunities.

_ASP.NET on_ the ._Net Core 1.0 framework enables the most flexible version of ASP._NET yet. Its modular design, updated programming model _and productivity improvements are certain to make it popular with developers. It is difficult to predict whether the cross-platform capability will be popular. Overall, it is good to see Microsoft re-inventing its product with the future in mind._

Chris from Software Cornwall discussed his success with F#. The simple layout and decluttered structure (no curly brackets or semi-colons etc) is a delight for common tasks. As the session was planned to be a few hours long, other questions have been shelved for another meetup.

We’d like to thank everybody for attending and sharing their questions and answers with the rest of the group. The free supply of pizza and Headforwards Beer was definitely a success, as usual.

As part of our ongoing development with the local tech community, we will plan to host .NET meetups in the coming months. If you’re a developer, .NET or otherwise, keep in touch regarding future events.
