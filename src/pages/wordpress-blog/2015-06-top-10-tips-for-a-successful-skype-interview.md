It is becoming more and more common to have your first interview for a new role over Skype, particularly if the role would require relocating. It is something we do regularly here at Headforwards as we recruit talented software developers from all over the globe. However the prospect of a Skype interview can be a bit daunting- so here are our tTop 10 tips for a successful Skype interview to help you out.

**1\. Be prepared.**  
Download [Skype](http://www.skype.com/en/) in advance; don’t wait until 5 minutes before your interview. You can almost guarantee you will have issues if you do that.

**2\. Have a professional User name.**  
You may have a hilarious Skype handle that all your friends love, but it may not give the best first impression to the company you are trying to land a job with. Pick something professional and as close to your name as possible. Similar to the email address you use for job applications. You should also selected an appropriate profile picture- why not use the one from your [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com) page?

**3\. Dress to impress.**  
We all know the old adage “dress for the job you want, not the job you have.” However this doesn’t mean we should all be going around dressed like Batman! For an interview you should always dress smartly and professionally- even if the role doesn’t demand it. This is no different with Skype interviews. The person doing the interview might not be able to tell you don’t have the bottom half of your suit on but it will change the way you conduct yourself.

**4\. Check the background.**  
It seems obvious, but you are so used to looking at what is in your room you may not see some potentially deal-breaking items. Last nights wine bottle may make it look like you needed a pick me up with breakfast! Give the room a thorough once over and make sure it is clean, tidy and uncluttered.

**5\. Practise.**  
Skype can seem a bit unusual if you are not use to it, take the time to have practise Skype calls with friends and family before hand. It is also a good idea to get them to ask you potential interview questions so you can practise the scenario and your answers.

**6\. Listen.**  
Make sure you take the time to listen properly, and that you can hear what is being said. Sometimes there can be a slight delay and it is easy to accidentally talk over each other. Try leaving a slightly longer pause than normal between question and answer to be on the safe side. If your speakers are not loud enough wear headphones, this will help stop you giving any embarrassing answers because you have misheard the question.

**7\. Eye Contact.**  
This is a skill on Skype. Make sure you look at the camera and not your own face on the screen. As with a traditional interview it is important to maintain eye contact, which can be hard through a screen. Looking into the camera is the best way to do this, but ensure you can still see their face so you can gauge reaction. DO NOT stare at your own face on the screen. I know it is strangely mesmerising but believe me it will distract you and they will be able to tell.

**8\. Body language.**  
Body language is good, sitting still like a porcelain doll is not. Now don’t get me wrong we don’t want you leaping around all over the screen, but do make sure to nod at correct points and use hand gestures appropriately. This is one of the reasons why a Skype interview is better than a phone interview- so make the most of it.

**9\. Avoid interruptions.**  
If you share a house with other people make sure they are aware you have an important interview scheduled from home. You don’t want your housemates wandering out of the shower and into shot, or an excited toddler jumping in your lap asking to watch Peppa Pig as you have your laptop out.  
If you are doing your interview in a public place- (brave) make sure you wont be disturbed. If you are in a café politely as the waitress not to disturb you as you will be on an important Skype call.

**10\. Relax- and be yourself.**  
Perhaps most importantly, relax, breath and be yourself. Take a moment to gather yourself and your thoughts before you start. Take a few deep breaths. Focus.  
Then knock their socks off!
