If you have been on the internet in the last few days you have probably come across #ILookLikeAnEngineer

For those of you who don’t know, this new hashtag has come about after [Isis Wenger](https://twitter.com/isisanchalee) wrote an article for [Medium](https://medium.com) about what it is like [working in tech as a woman](https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/you-may-have-seen-my-face-on-bart-8b9561003e0f).

It is sad to read about some of the experiences she has been through, and how unprofessional some people can behave.

She was recently used in an Ad campaign for her current company, [OneLogin](https://www.onelogin.com/). The Ad features a picture of her along with a quote about her team.  Facebook did not react well to the Ad claiming that it was a poorly planned marketing campaign, and that she doesn’t even look like an engineer.

This has raised an interesting question, what does an engineer look like?

Isis ended her article by saying:

_“Do you feel passionately about helping spread awareness about tech gender diversity?  
__Do you not fit the “cookie-cutter mold” of what people believe engineers “should look like?  
__If you answered **yes** to any of these questions I invite you to help spread the word and help us redefine “what an engineer should look like”._

_**#iLookLikeAnEngineer**_

This hashtag has really taken off – leading to engineers all over the globe sharing photos of themselves, including our very own [Natalia](https://twitter.com/natkuTala).
