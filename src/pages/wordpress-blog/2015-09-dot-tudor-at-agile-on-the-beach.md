[Lyssa](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/lyssafeecrump), _our Marketing Manager, has written the following article about_ _Dot Tudor at Agile on the Beach and her talk entitled “I’m an Alien”_

[Dot Tudor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dottudor) is founder and Technical Director of [TCC Limited](https://www.tcc-net.com/), a company who specialise in business change and helping people improve the way they manage projects.  
She also won “Best Agile Coach / Mentor” at the UK Agile Awards 2011.

Tudor’s talk was entitled “I’m an Alien – a Business Analyst in an Agile World”

![Dot Tudor at Agile on the Beach - BA, I'm an alien ](//headforwards.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Dot-Tudor-at-Agile-on-the-Beach-BA-Im-an-Alien.jpg)

It was a discussion on Business Analysts and Product Owners. Is there space for both of these roles in an agile environment? Are they just the same role? Or are they both equally important?

To get the ball rolling we were split into teams and given a couple of tasks to do- simultaneously!  
One was to count how many ‘aliens’ there were during [“Englishman in New York”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d27gTrPPAyk) by Sting.  
The second was to come up with a company name and logo.  
The final task was to come up with different skills and attributes that  could be attributed to a BA and PO, either individually or combined.

![Dot Tudor at Agile on the Beach - so what skills/ attributes ](//headforwards.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Dot-Tudor-at-Agile-on-the-Beach.jpg)

Most of teams were caught out by the number of aliens, with only one team noticing the full sized one running around on the balcony during the song!

So what was the point of this exercise? Well Tudor wanted to make sure that we had too much to do at once, as is often the case in the business world.  
When we are working on our own, we can’t do everything and that is why it is sensible to split the workload.  
Tudor has come across a lot of people who think that the Product Owner and Business Analyst are really just one role, however she believes this is not the case.  
There are, however, similarities between the two.  
They both must look after the ‘here and now’ as well as the future and they need to look after the customers.  
They also need to enable everyone to deal with change, but they both deal with very different types of change. The Business Owner needs to be forward thinking when it comes to change, what exciting ideas can the team be working towards. Whilst the Product Owner needs to be thinking about change for now, how to improve the current situation.

Tudor is very clear on one point: One person can’t do it all.

When you are focused on the task, the world can pass you by. You might not see the alien in the room, the one running around on the balcony. (I know I didn’t!)

So who does what?

Well they both share some of the same skills and responsibilities – Testing, Development, Business and Analysis. (Or the 4 Agile Amigos as Tudor called them.)

According to [Ellen Gottendiener](https://www.ebgconsulting.com/about/) there are 9 things every Product Owner should know:

1\. Put the end before the means  
2\. Build empathy for your customer  
3\. Stand up  
4\. Cozy up  
5\. Fess up  
6\. Decide how to decide (prioritise)  
7\. Move in measurable inches (a small step at a time)  
8\. Develop telescopic vision  
9\. Use Roadmaps as a guide

There are also 9 things every Business Analyst should know:

1\. Clarify the end- check alignment with the strategy  
2\. Build empathy with the PO, Dev team and others  
3\. Stand up  
4\. Cozy up – to the PO and Dev team  
5\. Fess up – facilitate effectiveness  
6\. Guide prioritisation – within timeframes / objectives  
7\. Assist with incremental planning by asking “What small, valuable piece can we deliver early?”  
8\. Draw diagrams / create models / visibility  
9\. Respect- the customer, the PO, the team

Finally some top tips for both Business Analysts and Product Owners:

Look at the Root cause, not the symptom.  
Requirement not solution.  
Value not quantity.  
Bring key resources together.  
Document “just enough” and “just in time” Keep the detail out of it until the last responsible moment.  
Finally, know the business case and share with each other.

Dot Tudor at Agile on the Beach gave us a really interesting look at the roles of the Business Analyst and the Product Owner. They do over lap in places, but she has made a compelling case attesting to the fact you still need both people.

If you would like to know more on this topic read Dot Tudor’s book the [AgileBA Handbook](http://www.dsdm.org/product/agileba-business-analysis-handbook), in it she gives practical and comprehensive guidance on the role of business analyst.
