Recently three members of the Headforwards team (Emily, Tom and Paul) travelled to [Mumbai, India](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/mumbai-bombay) on a work trip.

They flew overnight on Sunday to arrive in Mumbai on Monday morning.  
After only a short journey from the airport they arrived at the [Westin Mumbai Garden City Hotel](http://www.westinmumbaigardencity.com/), where they would be staying for the week. The views from the hotel were spectacular, particularly where it overlooked the park.

The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and really made the team feel at home.  
Whilst they were there, the team met with some partner colleagues who they are collaborating with on our next generation of [Load Balancers.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing))  
A load balancer is essentially a device that acts as a reverse proxy-distributing network or application traffic across a number of servers. -This increases the capacity and reliability of an application.

We are confident working on projects with people on a global scale and are very comfortable using the Internet as a tool for this. The Internet enables us to share files easily, work effectively, communicate rapidly and manage tasks efficiently. However even in this digital world it is sometimes still helpful to meet face to face. Meeting in person helps establish better rapport in relationships, which is important in teamwork.  
The Headforwards away team found that socialising with our Indian and Japanese partners helped take their working relationship to the next level, as they gained a sounder understanding of who they are as people, not just workers.

Our colleagues in India were extremely welcoming and organised some delicious curries for team lunches, which I am told made a refreshing change to all the pasties they eat here!  
Most of the trip was taken up with work, however they did find time to explore the local supermarket to buy some gifts for their families and the rest of the team here. Back in the office we particularly enjoyed the unusual [Lychee Jellies.](http://www.amazon.com/Cocon-Lychee-Jelly-300g/dp/B00JLL1SWI)

The markets were vibrant and exciting. They were full of beautiful colours and enticing smells along with a queuing system that would have seen a riot in the [Pool Tesco!](http://www.tesco.com/store-locator/uk/?bID=5170)

Paul Syrett said **_“__Working for a company which has a global presence gives us insight in to the working style and the concerns of people around the world. What struck me was that even though the technology that we work with is the same, the challenges faced by our colleagues elsewhere in the world are sometimes quite dramatically different.”_**

He was particularly struck by how different the commutes were.

**“_In Cornwall, we are lucky to live in one of the most beautiful counties – with a very low population density. Visiting Mumbai, where there are 21m people in 603km2, (34,000 people per km2) as apposed to Cornwall’s 530,000 in a 3563km2 area (which is 149 people per km2). In Cornwall we battle with the daily commute on a single lane roads. In Mumbai, there are approximately six lanes of traffic trying to use three lanes of road, whilst avoiding potholes and pedestrians so the challenge of just getting to work every day is immense.  
__I left Mumbai hoping to be able to return to explore the city and the country in more depth, but glad that I now have friends there through work who will be able to show me around next time I visit!”_**

One of the great things about working at Headforwards is that it opens up doors for exciting experiences. The small team that went to Mumbai all found the trip to be really beneficial and a great learning experience.  
We look forward to more worldwide meetings and collaborations.
