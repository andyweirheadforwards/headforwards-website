Just because summer has ended doesn’t mean the Headforward team adventures have to!

This years winter activities included laser tag at [Bombadingas](http://www.bombadingas.co.uk/), bowling at [Truro Bowl](http://www.truro-bowl.co.uk/bowling/2229686) and enjoying some tasty Indian food at various restaurants in [Truro](http://www.enjoytruro.co.uk/welcome).

For those of you who haven’t played laser tag, it is a sport where you attempt to score points by shooting each other with infrared emitting guns, whilst wearing targets. The game has been around since the late 70’s and is a favourite activity for kids parties as well as Headforwards outings!  
It is quite similar to [paintball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paintball), but much less painful!

You are probably familiar with bowling, but perhaps not with how seriously our team of developers take it! It is always a fun filled evening!  
Please take a look at the photos we have taken of our evenings out, if you click on one image you can open a lightbox slideshow.
