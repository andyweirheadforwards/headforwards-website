There are a lot of terms and key phrases used within the Agile world, and it can be a bit hard to understand if you are not “in the know”  
So we have put together a short glossary to help you understand what your Agile Software team are talking about.

[**Agile**](http://www.headforwards.com/2015/06/what-is-agile/) – this is the base of it all, it is a conceptual framework used when undertaking software projects. Agile methods are multifaceted and there is no one single approach.

**Agile Manifesto** – this was the formal announcement of the 4 key values and 12 principles of being Agile, as proclaimed by the innovators who coined Agile.

**Agile Project Management** – focuses on customer value and team integration over tasks. This is not just for the Software world anymore but can be successfully used in Sales teams, marketing departments and most other areas of business.

**Agile Software Development** – is where Agile all started. it is a group of software development methods where solutions are found through self organizing teams.

**Application Lifecycle Management** – the development and maintenance of application software.

**Behaviour Driven Development** – is a combination of refined practices that stem from Test driven development.

**Backlog** – this is the prioritised features list that contains short descriptions of all the desired functionality of a product.

**Build-measure-learn** – this is a feedback loop in place to help deliver the minimum viable product.

**Burndown Chart** – is a chart showing the work left to do against the time left to do it in.

**Burnup Chart** – is a chart showing work completed during iteration.

**Continuous Delivery** – is a software development method where software is built so that it can be released to production at any time.

**Continuous Deployment** – this is the next stage of Continuous Delivery, where every change that passes the automated tests is automatically put into production.

**Continuous Integration** – is when developers integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. This enables issues to be found and solved quickly.

**Cross-Functional Team** – again, this is not just for the software world. This is a group of people with different talents and knowledge bases working together towards a common goal.

**Daily Scrum/ Stand-up** – this is not surprisingly a daily event, of 15 mins or less, where the Development team replan the next days’ work during a sprint. These are normally done standing up to encourage them to be short.

**Definition of Done**– this is important; it is a shared understanding of the expectations that software must live up to, in order to be released. This enables the team to be working towards to same goal.

**Estimation** – this us where the size of stories points and tasks are agreed in a product backlog.

**Extreme Programming (XP)** – this a software development methodology, which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements

**Iteration** – is the act of repeating a process trying to reach a desired goal, target or result. Each repetition is also called iteration.

**Kanban** – is another popular method of Agile, it ensures that every stage of the process from definition of task to delivery to customer is clear for all participants to see.

**Minimum Viable Product** – this is what enables quick delivery to customer. It is the smallest thing that can be built that delivers value to the customer.

**Pair Programming** – this is an agile technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One inputs code while the other reviews each line as it is entered. One is the driver, the other is the navigator but it is important the roles are switched regularly.

**Planning Poker** – this is an estimating technique where the whole team agree on the size of the task and the effort needed.

**Product Backlog** – this is a list of work in the order it needs to be done in. This enables a product to be created, maintained and sustained whilst being managed by the Product Owner.

**Product Owner** – is the person who is liaises with the client, and ensures the team understands the big picture. They ensure the product backlog and story points are in order.

**Refactoring** – this is when existing software code is changed in order to improve the overall design.

**Retrospective** – this happens at the end of a sprint, it enables the scrum team to analyse the past sprint and plan for improvements.

**Scrum** – is an Agile methodology that acts as a framework to support teams in complex product development.

**Scrum Master** – is the role within the scrum team accountable for guiding, coaching, teaching, and assisting a Scrum team whilst making sure they are not being blocked on tasks.

**Sprint** – this is the name given to a time frame given to achieve the set tasks. Sprints are done consecutively without intermediate gaps.

**Sprint Backlog** – this is an overview of the development work needed to achieve a sprint goal that is managed by the development team.

**Sprint Planning** – this is done at the start of a sprint. It enables the scrum team to inspect the work in the product backlog and decide what is most valuable to be done next. Then put that work into sprint backlog.

**Sprint Review** – this is done at the end of a sprint to conclude the process. The scrum team and stakeholders inspect the product resulting from the sprint. From this they can look at the impact of the work done and then update the product backlog to maximise the value of the next sprint.

**Story Points** – these are units of estimation measuring complexity and size.

**Task** –user stories can be broken down in to one or more tasks. Tasks are estimated in story points by the developers.

**Task Board / Story board** – is a wall chart with cards and sticky notes on representing all the work in the sprint. The notes are moved across the board showing progress.

**Test Automation** – is the use of software to control the execution of tests, the comparison of actual outcomes to predicted outcomes, the setting up of the test preconditions and other test control and test reporting functions.

**Test Driven Development** – is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle.

**User Story** – is written in simple everyday that captures what the end user wants to achieve. It is a placeholder for conversation between the clients and the team.

**XP** – is another software development methodology, which is designed to improve software quality whilst still being quick to respond to changing requirements.

**So there you have it, the Headforwards Agile Glossary.**
