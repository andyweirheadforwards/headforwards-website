This time last year I was working on my own projects with no real element of shared work with others. Prioritisation was driven merely by my own personal preference of what I thought was right and never stood back to ask if what I am contributing is in fact, valuable to the company. Of course, I had a pretty good idea of what was valuable but no true confirmation. I hardly ever briefed others on my work in progress, and rarely discussed future projects. There was never a discussion on what is important right now and what is important long-term.

Fast forward to the beginning of this year and lot has changed. I’ve only recently entered into the world of Agile when I began working at Headforwards a little over six months ago. I joined from a previous role where there was little to no emphasis on the importance of Agile. Learning Agile from the ground up can be tricky and, at times, frustrating. There were days where I would drift back into my old ways of working and close off from the team. Understanding the importance of breaking down tasks, working with others and ultimately, making projects feel less like a David and the Goliath scenario was something entirely new to me.

After 6 months of working in an Agile environment with a team of people sharing work and balancing the musts, woulds, shoulds and coulds, I am a little closer to working in an Agile mindset. I was lucky enough to attend this year’s AOTB which is the first Agile orientated conference I’ve ever been to. If you’ve not attended before, I highly recommend it. As the title suggests, AOTB is all about the practices of Agile in the workplace. The major tracks are broken down into Software, Teams, Practices, Business and Product plus an added Bonus track containing extra talks based on Agile methodologies. The event attracts a myriad of different people from all walks of life – the main attendees are usually ceo’s, cfo’s, software developers, product owners, and Scrum Masters plus a sprinkling of marketeers and event organisers. Do not be mistaken into thinking you must first know Agile to attend – I met with many people who are at the very beginning of their Agile journey and are looking to learn and talk about all the techniques and methods using by different companies and individuals.

At Headforwards, we are team focused – a lot of what Agile is and does, benefits teams. This was emphasised by many of the speakers at this year’s event and resonated with our own core beliefs around how we operate. As an Agile newbie, here are a few of the most important nuggets of information I took away from the event.

Continuous Learning is Good.
----------------------------

Diana Larson’s brilliant opening keynote homed in on the necessity to keep learning and learning out loud. When something goes wrong, how do you deal with it? Do you quietly fix the issue? “Let’s pretend it never happened, I’ll just fix this now and carry on with what I was doing” – skimming over issues can be detrimental to the success of Agile and the general level of efficiency within a team. By fully acknowledging that something is wrong, telling others and then addressing the issue is the perfect way to stop it happening again. Of course, actually knowing it’s an issue in the first place helps. Larson also spoke about the need to keep moving forwards.

> “There is always a Netflix to your Blockbuster” – Diana Larson

Nothing is static. Keep learning, or face the consequences. “We live in a VUCA world” – Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous. She spoke about how it is good practise to frame work as a series of learning problems, not execution problems. Allow time for learning; before you can get good at anything, you need to be comfortable with the fact that you’re going to suck at it. Nobody is master overnight – it’s very easy to self-certify yourself as a professional in an environment where nobody else specialises in your skillset. Doing this can be damaging to your own ability to learn more; if you think you already know everything, then the requirement to learn more is less important.

Learning is beneficial not just to you, but to your team as well. Don’t feel embarrassed to say “I need to figure out how to do this” or “I’ve never done that before” – go and find out. Make time and space for learning. Be ready to take on new and exciting challenges that require you to learn a new skill, don’t hide away and leave somebody else to pick it up.

Failure is an Option
--------------------

I know, it seems like a strange thing to say and so many organisations will say the opposite. This whole process of learning requires the ability and space to experiment and sometimes fail. Ilan Kirschenbaum’s talk “Seven dangerous things to let your team do” looks at how we should be giving ourselves and others around us the permission to fail. It’s difficult to learn when we have nowhere to experiment with new methods or practises if failure is not an option.

The upshot of creating an environment like this is a boost of confidence. Knowing that if an idea crashes and burns in an unholy mess, we learn from it and move on. We might even adjust the idea and make it work based on the information during the previous attempt.

Burnouts Hit the Best People
----------------------------

Part of an effective team is working together to avoid burnout, boreout and general fatigue during projects and ongoing work. It is estimated that 10% of the UK working population is suffering from burnout. So what can we do to prevent it? Why does it happen?

> “Burnouts hit the best people, because they care.” – Anna Obukhova

Summed up in a single line – Anna’s talk on “Fragile Agile” investigates the reasons exhaustion and fatigue build up in teams and how to identify the symptoms. Obukhova spoke about how the downward spiral of tiredness and depression can be difficult to escape unless something drastic is done about it. An example cycle may begin with general tiredness. Perhaps you’re not sleeping very well. This tiredness begins to affect the efficient and output level of your work. The guilt of working slower and less effective means you stay late, working longer hours which, in turn, causes the level of tiredness to rise and rise. A lot of the Anna’s talk focused on Agile Coaches and Scrummasters actively identifying these stages of exhaustion early on to help mitigate damage to the project and, more importantly, the team. I feel that these same tools can be used by individuals to look out for themselves and their team as well as depending on a Scrummaster / Facilitator to monitor the situation.

Something I’ve not heard of before: a death march project – the team is suffering from burnout and the project is stalling. Deadlines are fast approaching but neither the team nor the project is in a fit state to continue. Do you continue to push through to release something that is flawed and not production ready, or do you take a step back and realise that the project is going to miss its target?

There comes a time where, to some extent, you must admit defeat. Regather the troops and work out a better plan of attack. Again, I feel that many of us are guilty of not stepping back and assessing the overall situation – asking those basic questions to work out whether or not how things are going are good, or terrible. It’s difficult to admit that something won’t be finished on time, or that you just don’t have the capacity to continue at the rate in which things are happening. If a team is truly Agile, the handover or sharing of work shouldn’t be an issue \[providing they possess the skill set to do the work\] use this to your advantage to help spread the workload. Here at Headforwards we try to be as transparent as possible within our team. This gives us the ability to work individually or as a team across different departments of the business team, effectively clearing tasks to help each individual manage their own capacity.

Anna makes a solid point on the importance of health and wellbeing within a team. I think it’s something everybody can learn from and apply to their own work lives.

AOTB is a huge event and it is impossible to attend every single talk while also trying to absorb the unlimited stream of information. As I work predominantly in marketing, I planned my days around team focus and agile analysis. There was no shortage of talks assessing the various methods and practises in Agile that can be deployed into my area of expertise. I found myself swamped by new ideas and viewpoints I’d previously not thought of, which was great. One of the greatest parts of attending events such as AOTB is the vast expanse of knowledge offered not only by the speakers, but by every delegate. Conversations over new, exciting and sometimes controversial ideas were everywhere and, in a lot of cases, fueled by the odd bottle of our BDD beer during the evenings…

Agile is everywhere. It boasts a huge success rate for companies who take the time to onboard its methodologies. Our very own Lyssa Crump spoke about her journey into Agile and adopting its methods for use in Marketing. She makes it clear how important it is to our process.

> “Marketing is hectic, and could benefit from Agile processes…” – Lyssa-Fee Crump

We are constantly shifting and changing our approach to marketing and how we can better integrate Agile practices to streamline our workflow. It’s a constant work-in-progress as we analyse and tweak our process.

While my focus of Agile is primarily in marketing, it is of course used widely across software development. As a few of our developers also attended, here is Andy Weir sharing his thoughts on AOTB. Andy is a software developer doing great work for the Special Projects Division. He very kindly held a [Headtalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrdsWOBh4P8) to share the key takeaways from AOTB 2017.
