Are you dreaming of a different life? One where your work life balance is not affected by long commutes home on stuffy trains or stuck in long traffic jams.  
Why not relocate somewhere new, where your journey home takes you through fields and you can squeeze a quick surf in on your lunch break.  
But wait, you have to be in the cities to get the good jobs…right? Wrong!

Lots of companies have set up shop in exciting locations across the world, and you can work there too!

A recent conversation with a friend from ‘up North’ has prompted me to write this piece. He is a graphic designer who has been looking to relocate but feels as though people would dismiss his application because he is outside their catchment area.  
This is a common misconception, but please remember companies want to hire the right person for the role, regardless of where they are currently living.

Obviously there are additional costs involved in travelling great distances for an interview, however most companies will offer a [Skype ](http://www.skype.com/en/)call for the first interview.

Here at Headforwards we do this a lot and we find it to be extremely beneficial to both the applicant and us.

If the concept of a Skype interview is new and daunting to you, check out our [Top 10 Tips for a Successful Skype Interview](http://www.headforwards.com/2015/06/top-10-tips-for-a-successful-skype-interview/). You will be a pro in no time.

We are based in [Cornwall,](https://www.visitcornwall.com/,) which is an extremely beautiful county full of countryside and beaches. Who wouldn’t want to live here?

There is a strange misconception that the majority of people moving to Cornwall are doing so to retire and not because of work. However the predominant reasons are economic and lifestyle. A large number being ‘returners’ for example – people who left to study elsewhere and have come back to settle down. Internal migration is the single greatest driver of population change in Cornwall.

Cornwall County Council Demographic Evidence Base 2011

The above table from the Cornwall County Council shows the number of people migrating in and out of Cornwall. That is a lot of people coming to Cornwall to work, which supports the theory that there are career opportunities down here.

It isn’t just Cornish companies either; businesses are opening new premises south of the Tamar all the time. For example [Kings College London](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/index.aspx)  have just selected Quintrell Downs, near Newquay as the location for its [IT Service centre](http://www.insidermedia.com/insider/south-west/131669-invest-cornwall-win-kings-college-london-pitch/).

So if you are now asking yourself, Can I relocate?  Then the answer is an almighty yes!

First choose where you want to live, and then search for companies within that sector.

You may be surprised what you find.
