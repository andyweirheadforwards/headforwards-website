Have you been searching for Software Jobs UK?  
We currently have a large number of new roles available that may be suitable for you.

We are an outsource software development company based in Cornwall, South West England.  
Cornwall may seem like an odd choice for a growing software company but it is fast becoming a hub for agile software development.  
It is home to the renowned Agile conference, [Agile on the Beach](http://agileonthebeach.com/), and it was also ranked as the second fastest growing Tech Hub in the UK in the 2016 [Tech Nation Report.  
](http://www.techcityuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Tech-Nation-2016_FINAL-ONLINE-1.pdf)

Showing that is not just us that believe Cornwall is the perfect place for a Tech company.

Our outsource model is different to most companies. We partner with our clients on long term projects, creating intricate and innovative software.  We don’t believe in having software developers sat waiting on the bench,  nor do we believe in shoehorning people into roles they are not right for.
