[Lyssa](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/lyssafeecrump), _our Marketing Manager, has written the following article about Headforwards at Agile on the Beach and their talk entitled “The Open Agile Profiling System”_

[Toby Parkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobyparkins) and [Craig Girvan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/craiggirvan) are both directors at Headforwards, an outsource software development company based in Cornwall.  
They believe that being [agile](http://www.headforwards.com/2015/06/what-is-agile/) has played an instrumental part in their success and they want to help others in becoming more agile.

Whilst they were at [Agile on the Beach](http://agileonthebeach.com/craig-girvan-toby-parkins-the-open-agile-profiling-system-live-blog/) they talked about the Open Agile Profiling System they are developing, but how do you assess how agile a person or organisation is?

This is a hard question to answer. How do you measure something that means lots of different things to different people.

It can be very subjective, however it is still an important question to ask.

The [Headforwards](http://www.headforwards.com/who-we-are/) Open Agile Profiling System started after they were approached by one of their clients who requested that they come in and assess how agile they were.

They approached this by initially going on a fact finding mission.  
They read about the companies existing processes, interviewed team members, opened discussions and observed the teams at work.  
They felt that by asking for anonymous feedback they could get some honest answers from the team, that could then be relayed back to the company.

But what questions should they ask the team to get the best insights into how they worked? This is where their Profiler came into play.

Whilst conducting research for their Open Agile Profiler; Parkins and Girvan came across lots of existing tools, which was fantastic. However they found them to be a bit limiting and often closed which could be frustrating. They want to create something that is open, so that the whole community can use it and benefit from it.

When they first started developing their Open Agile Profiler they put together some _“symptoms of agility”_  from looking at the Agile Alliances Practises Guide.

The dilemma they then faced was _“how do you measure agility?” _There is no one size fits all for agile.

Parkins and Girvan said that _“The first thing you have to do to be agile, is have retrospectives”_  
However if you did **just** this, how would it effect the other principles?

It became clear to them that there wouldn’t be one set of questions that would work for everyone. The size of an organisation would effect the outcomes and requirements. A company with only 3 people has very different needs to one with 1500.

This results in the profiles from the Open Agile Profilier V0.1 not being comparable between organisations.

So, they want their profiler to have a selection of questions for the user to select from, depending on what their goals are.

Their initial set of question stemmed from the Principles of the Agile Manifesto, however they are now working hard on creating new question ranges for their Open Agile Profiler.

Do you want to get involved?
----------------------------

Parkins and Girvan are looking to create a focus group to help with the development of the Open Agile Profiling System.

They are opening this up to anyone who wants to be involved, as this will be a truly collaborative and open project.

They will be creating a [Slack](https://slack.com/) channel to enable ease of communication for those participating in the project.

If you would like to be involved please contact Headforwards by emailing [hello@headforwards.com
