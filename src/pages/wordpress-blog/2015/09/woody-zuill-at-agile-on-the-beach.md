[Lyssa](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/lyssafeecrump), _our Marketing Manager, has written the following article about Woody Zuill at Agile on the Beach and his talk entitled “Mob Programming, A Whole Team Approach”_

[Woody Zuill](https://twitter.com/WoodyZuill), according to his website, is known as the illegitimate father of [Mob Programming](http://mobprogramming.org/).  It was this [time laps video](http://mobprogramming.org/mob-programming-time-lapse-video-a-day-of-mob-programming/) of him and his team that started the craze of Mob Programming. In his talk at [Agile on the Beach](http://agileonthebeach.com/) he discussed what Mob Programming is, how they made it work and how you can too.

Mob Programming is a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, on the same computer.

[![Woody Zuill on Mob Programming](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Mob-Programming-Woody-Zuill-at-Agile-on-the-Beach1-225x300.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Mob-Programming-Woody-Zuill-at-Agile-on-the-Beach1.jpg)

It is similar to [Pair Programming ](http://www.headforwards.com/2015/07/what-is-pair-programming/) where two people sit at the same computer and collaborate on code, however it expands further on this idea by involving the whole team.

Zuill’s team were learning Pair Programming and Test Driven Development, and they were practising these skills in a coding Dojo.  
It was at this time they had too many big, nasty projects to work on at once.  They needed to put some on hold for a while.

[![Woody Zuill at Agile on the Beach](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Woody-Zuill-at-Agile-on-the-Beach-big-nasty-projects-300x225.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Woody-Zuill-at-Agile-on-the-Beach-big-nasty-projects.jpg)

Once they had completed the urgent work, they returned to a big project they had put on pause. They decided it would be a good idea to have a meeting to refresh their memory and get the new members of the project up to speed.  
During this initial meeting they started to look at some code, some database tables and other details of the projects. They then started to try out a few ideas, write tests and change code.  
As they had all been learning and practising Pair Programming they found it very easy to pass the keyboard around as they worked.

Unfortunately the meeting room they were using was booked for another session, but as the team were feeling really engaged and motivated about what they were doing, they grabbed their stuff and found another space to continue their work.

They held a mini retrospective at the end of the day and the team all felt that it was a very productive exercise, so they arranged meeting rooms for the next day so they could continue to work in the same way.

For the next two weeks they continued working like this whilst constantly reviewing the process. They decided that they wanted to carry on using this method and it was around this time they came up with the term “Mob Programming”

However they were having some issues.  
Having to constantly move from meeting space to meeting space was a major one.  It was extremely disruptive.  
To solve this they set up a permanent base for their Mob Programming.

[![Woody Zuill - The object isn't to make art](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Woody-Zuill-at-Agile-on-the-Beach-Robert-Henri-quote-225x300.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Woody-Zuill-at-Agile-on-the-Beach-Robert-Henri-quote.jpg)

Zuill believes that if you create an environment for people where they can excel in their work, they will.

“_The object isn’t to make art, it’s to be in that wonderful state which makes art inevitable_” [Robert Henri](http://www.henrirobert.org/)

It was in creating this environment, that they discovered Mob Programming.

Next he addressed why would they want to work in this way.  
His reasons included learning, shared ownership, shared knowledge, less re-work and that it was fun. They also found that there was less ego to contend with.  
But most of all it was because the team decided they wanted to work this way.

There are some key things to think about when adopting this method.  
It is about individuals and their interactions. You must be mindful, show respect, consideration and kindness.

He said that working this way with people makes you better people. This resonated with me, and I can see what he means. Working in an ego free environment where everyone is given the chance to learn and the chance to be the best they can be whilst still creating great work. Well that sounds pretty fantastic to me.

It was at this point that Zuill took us through the logistics of working in this way.  
You have one driver, everyone else is a navigator. These roles are rotated every 10 minutes.

[![Woody Zuill- Mob Programming Driver Navigator ](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Woody-Zuill-at-Agile-on-the-beach-driver-navigator--225x300.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Woody-Zuill-at-Agile-on-the-beach-driver-navigator-.jpg)

Time is dynamic. If there are 9 of you, waiting an hour and a half could be too long. It depends on how many people are in the team, but 10 minutes is a good place to start.  
Zuills team set up a timer, so that at the end of every 10 minutes a the screen cuts out forcing you to switch roles.

They set up the room so that the screen is projected onto the wall, so everyone can see what is happening. The Driver is sat at the keyboard, and the navigators are sat around in a semi circle.

The big thing that the team noticed when working in this way was that they were more productive than they were when working individually.

Let’s look at what can destroy productivity.

[![Woody Zuill what destroys productivity ](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Woody-Zuill-at-Agile-on-the-beach-what-destroys-productivity--300x225.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Woody-Zuill-at-Agile-on-the-beach-what-destroys-productivity-.jpg)

The main issues identified are communication problems, decision making problems, meetings and technical debt as issues.  
They were often faced with questions about productivity. “How can we be productive with 5 people around one computer”

[![Woody Zuill- How can 5 people around one computer be productive](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Woody-Zuill-at-Agile-on-the-Beach-productivity--300x225.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Woody-Zuill-at-Agile-on-the-Beach-productivity-.jpg)

“Wouldn’t it be more productive to have them all working on different things?”  
Zuill says that it is hard to quantify the answer to this but that the Agile Manifesto says  
_“Working Software is the primary measure of progress”_

The year after Zuill’s team adopted Mob Programming they finished 10 times the number of projects than they did the year before adoption. This of course doesn’t take into account the size of any project, but it is a good bench mark.

Another key point he made was that when you are working with the team you have zero queue time.

[![Woody Zuill - queue time ](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Woody-Zuill-at-Agile-on-the-Beach-ideal-queue-time-300x225.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Woody-Zuill-at-Agile-on-the-Beach-ideal-queue-time.jpg)

You no longer have to wait for responses from other team members as they are there working with you. This increases productivity by reducing the amount of downtime and the disruption of waiting.

Another question he often heard was “Arn’t you guys just in meetings all day”

[![Woody Zuill, Mob Programming meetings ](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Woody-Zuill-at-Agile-on-the-beach-2015-meetings-300x225.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Woody-Zuill-at-Agile-on-the-beach-2015-meetings.jpg)

In fact they find that they need to have very few meetings now, as the team are aligned with each other all day.  
The team are in a constant learning environment, which they have found to be very powerful.

Zuill says it is important to remember that everyone makes mistakes. In showing each other your mistakes, you get better, you learn.  
The whole team is facilitating this learning.  
You are going to be exposed and it is scary. This is why kindness is such an important factor in Mob Programming.

Zuill’s says:  
_“Be prepared to contribute the right thing at the right time in the right way._  
_Pay attention to what works, and turn it up”_

![Woody Zuill do you recommend Mob Programming](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Woody-Zuill-at-Agile-on-the-Beach-Mob-Programming-300x225.jpg)

Zuill is clearly pleased with how Mob Programming has worked for his team. They have had great results, a rise in productivity and have created a nurturing environment.  
However he is very honest about the fact that just because the method worked for them, it doesn’t mean it would work for everyone.  
He is happy to share his experiences and from that he hopes you can make your own decision about trying it.
