[Lyssa](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/lyssafeecrump), _our Marketing Manager, has written the following article about Andy Bartlett at Agile on the Beach and his talk entitled “Herding Creative Cats”_

[Andy Bartlett](https://twitter.com/OneBartlett) is Product Design Manager at [Worlds Apart](http://www.worldsapart.com/), a Cornish company who create innovative children’s lifestyle products. They hold licences to many well known brands including Disney, Star Wars and Peppa Pig.

The problems…
-------------

Bartlett starts his talk by asking _“why agile?”_  
4 years ago the company was seeing rapid growth and with it they were, understandably, having some growing pains. People were stressed, the structure was chaotic and they were launching a massive 270 products a year!

There were a couple of issues that the team noticed needed rectifying, which is why they made the change to being agile.

They had a bespoke project management system in place but unfortunately it was 17 years old, a bit outdated and didn’t perform how the team needed it to.  It was owned by the companies MD and not many other people could use it the same way he could.

Another issue the team were having was poor estimations of work time, which had a knock on effect with work load pressure.

The happiness of the team is really important to Worlds Apart, the best way to see how happy everyone was was to ask them.  
According to their happiness index the team were rating 55%  
Worlds Apart were aiming for 85%

It was clear things needed to change.

Bartlett said: _“We don’t develop product, we develop teams and they develop product”_

This is a sentiment I can really relate with. It is about empowering your team, and putting them in a situation where they are able to excel.

He was working with a team who had an adversity to being controlled, he would often hear comments like:

_“I hate planning, it suffocates my creativity.”_  
_“The magic of some of my ideas gets lost as products go through the development cycle.”_  
_“I have no idea how my products perform once they leave development.”_  
_“I go home having done lots, but nothing properly.”_

Even though his team were delivering, they didn’t feel like they were achieving.  
It is crucial for people to feel like they are doing their jobs well, otherwise they end up losing motivation and feeling unworthy.

So what did Worlds Apart want to achieve by changing?

**Simplicity** instead of **complexity**  
**Visual** instead of **hidden**  
**Rhythm** instead of **AdHoc**  
**Reflect** instead of **repeat**

The solutions…
--------------

They took the first step toward making these changes by deciding to become brand led, and deciding that everyone should share ownership of the brand. Doing this gave the team a collective sense of endeavour and the clear visibility let everyone contribute easily.

   
They also started having metronomic weekly meetings as well as making a point to celebrate the team’s achievements, the micro success and small wins.  
Bartlett noticed significant improvement from these changes, one in particular was having their Disney artwork approved first time which never usually happened. I believe this was because the design team were in a happier place they were more productive in producing quality work that was inline with the brief.

The design team started to have daily stand ups for 30 minutes, but it wasn’t working quite right for them.  
They decided to make the meeting rooms more agile. They installed high top tables that enabled them to have their meetings around them. They also put the DNA of the brand up on the walls, enabling everyone to stay on message at all times.

In these morning huddles they kept it simple.  
_“Yesterday I…”_  
_“Today I am going to…”_  
_“Tomorrow I am going to…”_  
_“These are my issues…”_

**Bartlett believes the morning huddle is the most successful thing that they have managed to change.**

The next big challenge they had to face was their bespoke, internal software.  
This software was owned by the MD and senior stakeholders who believed it still did everything it needed to and didn’t want to part with it. Unfortunately it was full of bugs and work arounds meaning it was quite difficult for the team to use.

They decided to make a physical manifestation of their project management system which they put up on the walls. Unfortunately this didn’t seem to work very well, why would people want to maintain the boards when it is all being done digitally as well.

The next step they took was to try a more simple, traditional Kanban board. Through doing this they noticed that there was an awful amount of items stuck in their paused/blocked section.  
They couldn’t just make the paused section bigger, so what could they do?

By analysing the tasks they were being blocked on they noticed that there were some common themes. One of which was they always left two weeks for the Marvel and Disney items to be approved. In reality it always took much longer so this always made their estimates way off.

Having this board up on the wall highlighted many of the teams issues, which eventually led to them getting their own internal software developer solving one of their major problems.  
For the last couple of years I have had also used a Kanban board in my sales and marketing departments, it made a dramatic difference to the way I have worked. I am much more efficient and less likely to go for the smaller, easier wins. I have found it helps you be more analytical and strategic about your work. I would really recommend this technique to anybody, not just software developers.

They also put a big cargo ship up on the wall and every time a container was shipped they put it up on the board.

Bartlett told us that their shipping window for their products was between 20th April and 10th May.

[![Andy Bartlet- Worlds Apart Ship](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AndyBarlett_Sanity_check-300x225.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AndyBarlett_Sanity_check.jpg)

In reality only 16% of their product was shipped during this window.  
20%  was shipped during May- June  
21% was shipped in June  
27% was shipped in July  
A massive 16% of the merchandise didn’t even make it to retailers. This amounted to £50,000 worth of stock.

Displaying this ship on the wall provided a massive _“sanity check”_ for Bartlett’s team.  
He commented that legacy can be hard to change, but by making it visible, having it on the wall for everyone to see helps to change the culture. Displaying your tasks and blockages for everyone to see enables them to understand what is really happening. That is when changes get made.

It was interesting to hear about the Monopoly type of game that Bartlett’s team created for their end of sprint retrospectives. You can tell that as designers they are very visual and creative people, this has led to some wonderful ideas. They would stand around their Worlds Apart Monopoly board and work their way around it recording things they wanted to keep, things they wanted to do differently and things they needed to change.  
They would then take away 3 major actions for the next sprint, making sure to reflect and not repeat.  
These meetings seemed to be really powerful for the team, they would go to the meetings knowing that everyone in the room did the best that they could at the time.  
Now they all sign the board after a retrospective and put it up on the wall in the studio.  To me, this says that they are profoundly proud of the work they are doing and they way they are doing it.

The results…
------------

So how did the Worlds Apart design departments find their journey to becoming agile?  
Bartlett believes it was harder to implement it there than it would be in a software environment.  
They experienced varying levels of acceptance, how are you going to have cultural change when there are pockets of resistance?

At Worlds Apart they noticed that when one team got going, it rippled out to the other teams getting the other ‘cats’ going.  
They were all riding “The Change Rollercoaster” which is probably something we have all experienced before!

I found it fascinating to hear Bartlett talk about his journey implementing Agile into a creative company, where he was _“herding creative cats!”_  He puts a large amount of their success down to their mentoring from [Belinda Waldock](http://www.beingagile.co.uk/).

Bartlett was kind enough to pass on some tips for implementing agile into your own business.  
He says to try something.  If it is not working drop it as soon as you can.

Get a champion in a key position within the organisation.

Play with it, make it fun and engaging. This is something that is important in the Worlds Apart company culture which is why the Monopoly board works so well for them.

Their aim was to build the happiest team possible and becoming agile has really helped them achieve this goal.  
In 2013 the team scored themselves as 55% on the happiness scale.  
In 2015 the team scored themselves as 85%

One of the messages that has come from the team is that they are happier now because they are not being stifled. They have been given the space and the tools they needed to succeed.  
They have also decreased the number of products released a year to 180, which enables the team the time they need to create work they are happier with.

There was an article in [Design Week](http://www.designweek.co.uk/) about creative companies adopting agile. A staggering 84% of them saw a rise in team moral after they made the change, which shows that what happened at Worlds Apart was not a fluke, their success is being replicated in creative companies nationwide.

Bartlett’s final words were that the best thing about being agile is that it is like a sweet shop. Pick things up, if they are not working you can put them back down again and try something else.
