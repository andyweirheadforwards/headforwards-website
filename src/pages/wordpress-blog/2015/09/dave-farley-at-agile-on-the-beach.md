[Lyssa](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/lyssafeecrump)_, our Marketing Manager, has written the following article about _[Dave Farley](https://twitter.com/davefarley77) _at Agile on the Beach and his talk on Continuous Delivery._

Dave Farley kicked off day one of [Agile on the Beach](http://agileonthebeach.com/) 2015 by doing his keynote speech, which was directly followed by his talk “Introduction to Continuous Delivery”

[Dave Farley](http://www.davefarley.net) is co-author of the award winning book “[Continuous Delivery](http://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912)” and he is also one of the authors of ” The [Reactive Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/)”

One of his favourite quotes is:

_“Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results”_ **Albert Einstein**

He also believes that:

“_Science is human kinds greatest invention_.”

He was an early adopter of Agile Development Techniques, using tools like iterative development and continuous integration since the early 1990’s!

![The principles of continuous delivery - agile on the beach- Dave Farley ](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Dave-Farley-the-principles-of-continuous-delivery-at-AOTB.jpg)

In Dave’s talk at AOTB about Continuous Delivery, he discussed how he has used most models of Software development. Such as Waterfall, V model, Scrum and  Extreme Programming. He says that he has learnt something from each and everyone of these.

But which of these methodologies work?

![Dave Farley at Agile on the Beach. What works?](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Dave-Farley-at-Agile-on-the-Beach-what-works.jpg)

We see that Waterfall has a 29% failure rate, compared to Agiles 9%  
Waterfall methods have a 14% success rate, compared to Agiles 42%

![Dave Farley- what works- Agile on the beach](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Dave-Farley-Agile-on-the-beach-what-works-more-datas.jpg)

So what can we learn from this data taken from [Dr Dobbs Journal](http://www.drdobbs.com/author/Scott-Ambler) by Scott Ambler?

Firstly that an ADHOC approach  to development, where you make up your method on the spot is actually more successful than the traditional Waterfall Method.

Secondly, that Agile and Lean are the most effective methods of Software Development.

Farley goes on to say that doing Stand Ups in the morning doesn’t make you Agile.  
You need to learn, adapt and change.

It was clear during Farley’s Keynote speech that he is a big fan of Richard Feynman, and he chose this moment to refer to one of his earlier slides.

_“Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts. _  
_The first principle is that you must not fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool!_  
_It doesn’t matter how intelligent you are, if you guess and that guess cannot be backed up by experimental evidence then it is still a guess.”_  
**Richard Feynman**

We then went on to discuss cycle time.

If you have a cycle time of 103 days, as Farley had at one point, you do not have feedback.  
If you have a cycle time of 57  minutes you will always know which change you had made that caused an issue.

![Dave Farely - cycle time - Agile on the beach ](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Dave-Farley-Continuous-Delivery-at-Agile-on-the-beach.jpg)

Continuous delivery is a subversive idea.  
It changes every aspect of a business all the way up to how a CEO interacts with the team.

However, repeatable reliable processes are not always good for humans. Farley says this is why you should automate nearly everything.  
“Leave the humans to do all the bits they are good at and automate nearly everything else.  
Can you run a version of something that was saved 6 months ago? If you can- fantastic. – If not?  Your version control could be better.”

![Continuous delivery deployment pipeline - Dave Farley- Agile on the beach](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Dave-Farley-Agile-on-the-beach-Continuous-Delivery-Process.jpg)

Farley goes on to say that if your cycle time hurts you, you should do it more often.  
If you are struggling to release every 6 months then you should push yourself to do it every 3 rather than relax it to every 12.  
It is important to push yourself harder to perfect the process.

The problem is, you can never test to see if software is good.  
Ultimately you can only test and find faults.  
You need to do this to the point where you are confident that there are no more faults.

He often comes up against resistance to adopting Continuous Delivery.  
There are a few reasons why people try to resist CD that he sees repeatedly.

One concern he hears often is “_This is too risky, releasing all the time is a recipe for disaster_”  
He puts this fear at rest by talking about the [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/) build process:

![Dave Farley- the Amazon build process- at Agile on the Beach](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Dave-Farley-The-Amazon-Build-Process-Agile-on-the-beach.jpg)

Which amongst other things showed a 90% reduction in outage minutes triggered by deployment and a reduction in complexity.

Another reason for resistance is ” _This may work for small projects, but can’t possibly scale_”  
Farley then discusses the [Google](https://www.google.co.uk/) build process.

![Dave Farley- The Google Build Process- Agile on the beach ](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Dave-Farley-The-Google-Build-Process-AOTB.jpg)

Google do continuous builds and tests on commit for 60 Million builds per year and 100 Million lines of code.

Another common cause for concern is “_This may work for simple websites but my technology is too complex”_  
This is where Farley refers to [HP Laserjet Firmware](http://www.hp.com/country/us/en/uc/welcome.html) team experience.

Using Continuous Delivery transformed their development approach for all of their products and increased their developers productivity x 10.  
Making the move to Continuous Delivery also enables them to free up more time for innovation.

So what effect does the change to Continuous Delivery have on a business?  
It changes the economics of software delivery, as shown in the image below.

![Dave Farley- the effects of continuous delivery on business - Agile on the Beach](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Dave-Farley-the-effects-on-business-agile-on-the-beach.jpg)

It leads to 50% lower change failure rates.

![Dave Farley - the effects of continuous delivery on business part 2- Agile on the beach](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Dave-Farley-the-effect-on-business-part-2-agile-on-the-beach.jpg)

“We can now assert with confidence that high IT performance correlates with strong business performance, helping boost productivity, profitability and market share”

So if it was this amazing, lots of big companies would be using it right? Right!

![Brands practising Continuous Delivery- Agile on the beach ](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Dave-Farley-who-practices-continuous-delivery-AOTB.jpg)

Big companies such as [Nokia](http://www.nokia.com/en_int), [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/gb/),  [SAP](http://go.sap.com/index.html), [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/uk/), [ING](http://www.ing.com/en.htm) and [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/).

Dave Farley makes a compelling case for Continuous Delivery, one that is backed up with facts from case studies.  
If you were still unsure about it, after listening to Farley talk  would make it hard to continue to resist Continuous Delivery.
