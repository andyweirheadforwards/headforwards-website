Last week a few members of the Headforwards team had the pleasure of attending [Agile on The Beach](http://agileonthebeach.com/) in [Falmouth.](http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/)  Headforwards are proud to be one of the [sponsors](http://agileonthebeach.com/2015-sponsors/) of the event, along with some other fantastic companies.

Agile on the Beach is a two day business and technology conference that sees speakers from all over the world come to Cornwall to educate and inspire whilst also getting to enjoy a rather special beach party at [Gyllyngvase](http://www.gyllybeach.com/).

In fact [Software Development Today](http://softwaredevelopmenttoday.com/) ranks AOTB as the third in [The Top 50 Agile Conferences](http://softwaredevelopmenttoday.com/2015/01/the-top-50-agile-conferences-including-lean-kanba-scrum/), which means it must be something rather special.

This year AOTB had 350 business and software professionals attend as well as  [55 spectacular](http://www.headforwards.com/2015/07/agile-on-the-beach-2015/) speakers.

Whilst [Agile](http://www.headforwards.com/2015/06/what-is-agile/) was born in the Software world it is really interesting to see the impact it is making in the rest of the business world.

We will be posting a series of blog pieces about the event in general as well as the talks we attended, so please stay tuned for these.

The conference aims to explore a few key themes including Agile Software Craftsmanship, Continuous Delivery, Agile Teams, Agile Business and Agile Product Management.

Some of the talks include:  
Building Systems That are Never Done.  
By [Anthony Williams](https://twitter.com/a_williams)  
The Death of Continuous Integration.  
By [Steve Smith](https://twitter.com/AgileSteveSmith)  
Strategic Play with Lego Serious Play.  
By [Ole Jepsen](https://twitter.com/olejepsen)  
Can Guinness Help you Estimate?  
By [David Lowe](https://twitter.com/bigpinots)  
Waltzing with Branches.  
By [Chris Oldwood](https://twitter.com/chrisoldwood).
