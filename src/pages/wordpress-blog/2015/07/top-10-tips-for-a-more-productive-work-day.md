You are a hardworking and diligent, but sometimes it is easy to get off track and lose sight of what you are trying to accomplish. (Particularly on a Monday morning)

So we have compiled are our Top 10 Tips for a More Productive Work Day to try to help you kickstart next week in a productive way.

**1\. A Good morning routine.**  
Try to get up early. I know those extra 20 minutes of sleep seem extremely tempting but don’t be fooled. Getting to the office early, in a calm and chilled manner is much more beneficial. There is nothing worse than arriving at your desk all flustered and stressed from rushing- it sets the tone for your whole day.

**2\. Don’t check your phone.**  
I am guilty of this, when the alarm goes off on my phone I end up having a quick scroll through Facebook, checking the news and emails. Stop doing this. Instead play some good music, make your bed and eat a good breakfast whilst focusing on yourself and not what the rest of the world is doing. I have recently started trying this and it really has helped my focus.

**3\. Prioritise.**

Start each day knowing what you want to achieve. Sometimes this can be a good thing to think about on your way to work, as once you get there it is easy to get distracted by other tasks. Once you know what you need to be achieved work out how you are going to do it.  
I use Agile project management to manage my time and tasks. Since I was introduced to this methodology  I have managed to accomplish so much more as I was making the bigger tasks seem more achievable and not just doing the smaller, easier wins first.

**4\. Keep a tidy workspace.**  
On the surface it may seem like a waste of time, you have everything where you want it and you absolutely know where everything is at all times. Wrong. A tidy space really is a tidy mind. Spend a few mins of your time at the end of the day cleaning your space, filing paperwork away and washing your mug. You will thank yourself in the morning.

**5\. Try to do one thing at a time.**  
You may be well seasoned in multi tasking, and pride yourself on your abilities however if you can avoid doing this you should. Your important tasks deserve your full attention, and they are always completed to a higher standard when they have been. I know what it is like to be on a roll with writing something, to really be enjoying it only to then stop to take a phone call on an entirely different subject. Once I return back to writing it takes a while to get back into the zone. If you are doing this on a much bigger scale, think how much time is wasted whilst you are mentally readjusting.

**6\. Take breaks.**  
I took much longer than I care to admit to realise how important and beneficial this was. I was always too busy, with too much to accomplish to take breaks. I would scoff some food at my desk whilst typing one handed. Now I take a lunch break daily, I leave my desk and go outside for a walk. My productivity has increased dramatically. Giving yourself that little bit of down time, giving your brain space to think and getting the blood pumping again is actually really important.

**7\. Do what helps you concentrate.**  
For me it is music, I really enjoy listening to the radio at work. I find it inspiring and also motivating. I really struggle to work in silence; the sound of tapping keys becomes deafening and distracting. However I have worked with colleagues in the past that prefer silence and I must admit when I am doing numbers I need it to be quieter.

**8\. Set goals, then review and reward!**  
If you have key points you need to achieve vocalise them, and check on your progress. Do you need to **gasp** unplug the phone to get this crucial document done in time? Once the all-consuming task is done, on time and perfect – reward yourself. Treat yourself to a fancy latte. You deserve it.

**9\. Hydrate.**  
This I cannot stress enough, keep hydrated. Water is amazing and helps keep you on top of your game. Dehydration has a negative impact on our alertness and your concentration. It can be hard to keep track of how much water you are drinking, try keeping a bottle of water on your desk so you can easily see how much you are having.

**10\. Keep fit.**  
Now you might not see the relevance in this, but exercise helps you stay positive and positivity aids productivity. It is also helps you combat mental sluggishness.

So there you have it, 10 easy steps to making a more productive you.  
All you need to do is make a few slight changes to your routine and forge a few new habits and you will really see the benefits.
