You will most likely have heard about The Cloud recently, in fact most of us use it on a daily basis, but what is The Cloud?

Well firstly, it is not a physical thing it is more of a  concept. Essentially it’s a network of servers used for accessing and storing data and programs on the Internet.

The Cloud is a very broad term covering most online services, but it can be split into three core sections:

**IaaS** – Infrastructure as a service. This is mainly used by system admins, an example being [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.co.uk/).

**PaaS** – Platform as a Service. This is mainly used by developers, an example being [Azure.](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/)

**SaaS** – Software as a Service. These are mainly for the end user, for example [Google Docs](https://www.google.co.uk/docs/about/) and [Dropbox.](https://www.dropbox.com)

Fancy a quick history lesson? Lets look at how the cloud came to be.

Back in 1950s a mainframe took up an entire room! They were very big and extremely expensive which meant companies couldn’t afford to have one for every team member who needed one. This lead to timesharing methods being invented which let multiple users share access to data and CPU time. This was the original premise for cloud.

Then in 1969, [JCR Licklider](https://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/licklider.html) created the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) hoping that one day everyone would be able to access data and programs from any location. This was the network that was the original basis for the Internet.

However it wasn’t until the Internet got up to speed that the cloud was able to be rolled out to the masses. Remember how slow dial up was? It wasn’t until the 90’s that the bandwidth could cope with the concept of cloud. In fact it was in 1997 when the term ‘cloud computing’ was first used.

In 1999 [Salesforce](http://www.salesforce.com/uk/cloudcomputing/) became the first site to deliver applications and software over the Internet. They were pioneers in using cloud computing to deliver enterprise applications via a simple website.

10 years later in 2009 [web 2.0](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_2_point_0.html) hits, which leads to companies offering browser based enterprise applications, like Google apps.

So what are the benefits to working with The Cloud?

It enables your company to be quick and nimble- more Agile.

This is because you can quickly access resources, and have them updated easily. Before you would have to buy hard copied of things, now you can just download from the cloud. Cloud applications are also usually pay as you go, which means that the initial outlay is reduced ultimately making them more accessible

The on demand, self-service side of cloud has revolutionised our lives. Just think about downloading an app for your phone, how bizarre does the concept of going to a shop to buy one seem?

We use the cloud so much in our daily lives without even realising. It makes saving and sharing documents so easy and safe.

It also makes businesses become more efficient and enables them grow at a much quicker rate, in a sustainable way.

So that was our quick, not very technical introduction to The Cloud.

The Cloud is something that continues to excite us here at Headforwards.

We have gained a lot of experience working with Cloud management platforms and we find there are a lot of advantages to virtualisation.

If you have a Cloud project in mind, and need some developers to get it going for you please [get in touch.](http://www.headforwards.com/contact/) We would love to discuss your ideas and how we could make them work for you.
