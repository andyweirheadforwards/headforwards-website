Earlier this week, Headforwards were invited to Cornish radio station [Pirate FM](http://www.piratefm.co.uk) to talk about our upcoming [Software Squad event](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/headforwards-software-squad-tickets-17692901946).

Pirate FM is Cornwall’s number local radio station and has been on the air since 1992.  It was launched by [Roger Day](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p001d70g) and was even featured on BBC’s [Tomorrow’s World](http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/tomorrowsworld/).

The team at Pirate were extremely helpful and welcoming. They made us feel very relaxed and at home even making us a beautiful cup of tea.

We were excited to talk about Software Squad but also about what we do as a company and the [software](http://www.softwarecornwall.org/) industry in [Cornwall. ](https://www.visitcornwall.com/)

The interview was aired on the [Pirate 2](http://www.pirate2.co.uk) during their [Education and Training Show](http://www.pirate2.co.uk/shows/the-education-and-training-show/shows/), but don’t worry if you missed it you can listen again to the [podcast](http://www.pirate2.co.uk/podcasts/cml/4/52.mp3) online.

Through our Software Squad event we aim to inspire and educate the next generation of programmers. We hope to empower the students by showing them that they can have exciting and fulfilling careers in Cornwall.

It is being held at the [Pool Innovation Centre](http://www.cornwallinnovation.co.uk/pool-innovation-centre) on Tuesday 11th August, 2015.

The event is free, however you will need to book tickets in order to attend. You can book your tickets online through [Event Brite.](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/headforwards-software-squad-tickets-17692901946?aff=ehomesaved)

If you would like more information on Software Squad or about what we do here at Headforwards please [contact us](http://www.headforwards.com/contact/). We would love to talk to about it.
