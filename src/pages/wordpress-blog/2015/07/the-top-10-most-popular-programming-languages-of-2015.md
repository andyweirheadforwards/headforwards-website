[Codeeval ](http://blog.codeeval.com/) have published their list of most popular programming languages for 2015 and there are a couple of surprises!

The top 10 for 2015 are:

1.  Python
2.  Java
3.  C++
4.  C#
5.  Ruby
6.  JavaScript
7.  C
8.  PHP
9.  Go
10.  Perl

**Python** is often said to be the easiest language to learn. Google has invested in it heavily in the past few years, which has probably played a part in its rise in popularity. It is also the one we hear of being taught in schools the most.

**Java** is often used to build server side applications and is one of the core foundations for developing Android apps. It has a WORA mantra, meaning you write it once, run it anywhere. It is used for enterprise level applications, mobile-based applications, for building android apps and to make desktop applications.

**C++** is a general purpose, powerful language. It is actually quite an advanced language and is used for apps for phones and desktops.

**C#** is used a lot devolving Microsoft apps and works similarly to java.

**Ruby** is also known as Ruby on the Rails, which means it wins the award for my favourite name! It is also very easy to learn and quick to use.

**JavaScript** is actually nothing to do with Java, but it will be found pretty much everywhere on the web and it is used to add interactivity to sites. It is used for creating responsive user interfaces, and for animations and images on webpages.

**C** is the predecessor to languages like Java and C# and is small, fast and powerful. It may be the oldest but it is often recommended to be the first one you should learn.

**PHP** is an open source language and a must learn for web developers. It is used in dynamic heavy data websites and content management systems like WordPress.

**GO** was developed at Google and designed to help build simple, reliable systems.  
**Perl** is one of the least straightforward languages to learn but it can provide the tools for complicated problems like system programming. It is great for test automation.

So there you have it, the top 10 languages for 2015, according to Codeeval.

**To stay at the top of your game you need to know a combination of languages, we would love to hear which are your favourites to work with and which ones you use most commonly. **
