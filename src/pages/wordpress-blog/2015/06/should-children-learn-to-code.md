There seems to be a lot in the media at the moment about children learning to code, but what do you think about it?  
Are we getting children too involved with technology?

The BBC recently did a report on children in [Hong Kong learning to code](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32880185) after school.

Barclays bank are even getting in on this movement with their [Barclays Code Playground](http://www.barclays.co.uk/DigitalEagles/BarclaysCodePlayground/P1242686640999).

In fact from September 2014 changes to the [National Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study) were made that extended the study of computing  being taught in both primary and secondary schools.

**Key stage 1** are  expected to understand  what algorithms are. They should be able to create and debug simple programs and use logical reasoning to predict the behaviour of simple programs.

**Key stage 2** students are expected, amongst other things, to be able to design, write and debug programs that accomplish specific goals. Also they are taught how to use technology safely, respectfully and responsibly. Recognising acceptable/ unacceptable behaviour and identify a range of ways to report concerns about content and contact.

In **Key stage 3** students are taught to use one or more programming language to solve a variety of problems. To understand how instructions are stored and executed within a computer system along with how data of various types (including text, sounds and pictures) can be represented and manipulated digitally, in the form of binary digits

**Key stage 4** pupils are given the opportunity to study aspects of IT and Computer Science at a sufficient level to allow them to progress to further education or to a professional career.

These all seem like important life skills to be taught to our children, many of which translate into every day life and will stand the students in good stead for any career, not just one in IT.

However not everyone is for this technological revolution. An article on [ZD Net](http://www.zdnet.com/article/unless-kids-are-working-coding-should-not-be-taught-abbott/) said that the Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott disagrees with the idea of teaching children the basics of computer programming as he believes they will not need such skills until they reach working age.

It is important we ensure the teachers have the right resources and knowledge to take on this change, and that they feel empowered to do so.

I believe Mr O’Donohoe, the principle teacher of computing at Our Lady’s High School, put it beautifully in the [Independent.](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/educators-call-for-reform-in-how-programming-is-taught-in-schools-8934893.html)

_“I quickly discovered that I had to totally change my approach to teaching Computing,”_ he says_. “Where I once believed I was ‘the guardian of knowledge’ and all learning was accessed through me, I now realise that I am more of a facilitator. I can never possibly know everything that my pupils might choose to learn. Instead, to arouse their interest and curiosity, I provide them with an environment with discovery and challenge and questions are welcomed.”_

I find this all terribly exciting, we are helping to nurture a whole new generation of potential programmers and coders who will go on to shape the world of the future.

I imagine this new initiative will increase the number of women going into the software world, and also help people step away from the unflattering stereotypes of IT geeks.

If you want to give your child a helping hand, there are plenty of free online ways for them to learn and explore.  Check out [Code.org](https://code.org/learn) for some great learning games and apps.

So it looks like the decision has been made for us, our children are going to learn about coding and programming.  Are you happy about this? Or are there other areas in the curriculum you would like them to be focussing on?

We would love to hear your opinions on this, please get in touch on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/headforwards) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/headforwards) and continue the debate.
