As you may know we are based down in sunny [Cornwall](https://www.visitcornwall.com/), and whilst we live in the digital world and do a lot of networking remotely, sometimes it is valuable to meet with our clients face to face.

Not surprisingly some of these meetings happen on a Friday, so the weekend can be spent enjoying the Cornish culture and cuisine.

But lets be honest, Cornwall is quite out of the way and the journey can seem a bit daunting so we decided to share our inside knowledge with you and give you our top three ways to travel to Cornwall.

**1.Flying.**  
This is definitely the quickest way to reach us. You can fly to [Newquay airport](http://www.newquaycornwallairport.com/content/flights-newquay-0) from airports all over the country including Gatwick, Manchester and Birmingham. However it is worth noting that the summer schedule is different to the winter one.

**2.Trains.**  
First Great Western offers a great train service to Cornwall from all over the country. In fact the London Paddington – Penzance service even offers a [night sleeper train](https://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/your-journey/night-riviera-sleeper). Perfect for those early morning meetings.

**3.Driving.**  
Over recent years the Cornish roads have seen vast improvements, which makes commuting in and out much easier.Take the M5 to Exeter, and then join the A30, which takes you straight here to Pool, Redruth.  
If you are driving from London it takes roughly 5 hours, and about 6 hours from Manchester. Most of us have SatNavs in our cars now, however you can still use the [AA route planner](http://www.theaa.com/route-planner/index.jsp) online if you need to.

So there you have it, the top 3 ways to get to Cornwall for your next meeting with us.  
If you want any tips on where else  to visit whilst here, we are always more than happy to give you a few pointers.
