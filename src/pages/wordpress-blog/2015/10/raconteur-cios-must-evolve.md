[Raconteur](http://raconteur.net/) is a publishing house that produces special reports for [The Times](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/) and [The Sunday Times.](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/)  
They focus on creating high quality, relevant and informative content.

They have recently published an article about the evolving role a CIO has in a company.  
_“Continuous disruption is forcing companies to transform their IT at an accelerating pace, dramatically changing the role of the Chief Information Officer”_

In this article they propose that the old fashioned CIO is becoming obsolete and that a new breed of executive – the chief data officer (CDO) is taking over some important parts of the role.

They go on to discuss digital disruption, new technologies and their adoption in the workplace.

According to a recent [Vanson Bourne](http://www.vansonbourne.com/) survey 66% of disruption was generated by the cloud.

However 89% of people surveyed said that they find it challenging to simplify older systems whilst still trying to drive innovation. This means that a bi-modal approach is needed.

Headforwards Director and Scrum Master [Craig Girvan](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/craiggirvan) contributes to the article by saying:

_“The CIO in mature organisations is now in the crevasse between the rock and the hard place. On one hand, the CIO has gone to gemba- the real place work is done. In other words, they understand the goals and desires of their software and IT teams, and how these want to adjust their culture, process and practise to enable them to deliver better business value through their work. On the other hand, the CIO has the traditional organisation mindset of the rest of the board, holding back the very changes they know they need to action. Compare this CIO with the CIO of a startup and, no doubt, you will find the valley is not nearly so deep.”_

For a company to be truly agile and to be able to react to the range of new technologies available rapidly, change needs to happen on a fundamental level.

[Toby Parkins](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/tobyparkins), Director of Headforwards and UKNetWeb said:

_“CIOs normally are convinced of the benefits of agile. The challenge is getting the people between the top and the bottom to understand the benefits of how to implement it. It requires change at a cultural level, and in every organisation there will be a high percentage of people who quickly adopt and another percentage who resist the change. Trying to achieve change internally with an existing organisation is just hard and requires huge levels of persistence. These are leaders who are agile, unafraid and extremely skilled at overcoming organisation inertia, who can bring disruption to a business and convince their colleagues to join them.”_

Recruitment company Russell Reynolds used psychometric testing on 28 of the worlds most successful CIOs and they have concluded that a new category has emerged.

The article concludes by discussing the previous evolution of the CIO from the 1950’s “electronic data processing manager” all the way up to the 2010’s “field general” CIO
