2015 marks the13th year of The Hub Awards and Headforwards are extremely proud to be sponsors.  
_Drum roll please_…and the categories are…

**Best New Start Up**  
Sponsored by [Oxford Innovation](http://oxin.co.uk/) and [Unlocking Potential](http://www.unlocking-potential.co.uk/)

For the Best New Start Up there will be a lot to talk about in a short space of time. The business idea might be the brainchild of one person or a team. What’s most important is that the business is based in Cornwall and was launched after January 2013.

**Best Use of Digital**  
Sponsored by [Headforwards](http://www.headforwards.com/who-we-are/)

A company not embracing digital is like a dog without a bone right? Most people are doing it but are you or have you taken it to the next level? Have you got some really tangible results from an exciting digital campaign across any medium?

**Cornish Business Leader of the Year**  
Sponsored by [The Samphire Club](http://www.thesamphireclub.co.uk/)

Nominate or enter yourself and well and truly fly the flag for Cornwall’s business community. This new award is all about putting the spotlight on someone who epitomises a true Cornish business leader.

**Employee of the Year**  
Sponsored by [Worldwide Financial Planning](http://www.wwfp.net/)

Do you know a true Cornish business star? Or are you that person? If you or someone you know has made a significant impact on the Cornish business they work for this could be the year to enter this award. It could be linked to exceptional growth, acumen or even ultimate long service. If it’s someone worthy, we want to hear about them.

**Cornish Business of the Year**  
Sponsored by [Cornwall Chamber](http://www.cornwallchamber.co.uk/)

Nominate or enter your Cornish business of the year. It might be about growth, NPD or a sales success story. The criteria is quite broad – it’ll be up to you (if you get shortlisted) to convince our judges that you’re Cornwall’s business of the year.

**Creative Project of the Year**  
Sponsored by [Krowji Creative Space](http://www.krowji.org.uk/)

Cornwall oozes creative talent. This new award will celebrate the successes of a project that can demonstrate real results or impact because of its creative backbone.

If you you or someone you know deserves to win one of these prestigious awards you can [nominate](https://cornwallhub.org/nominations/) them or yourself online. But be quick! Entries close at midnight on Monday 2nd November.
