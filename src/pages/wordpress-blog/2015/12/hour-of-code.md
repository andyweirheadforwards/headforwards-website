You may have noticed we mentioned Hour of Code in our blog piece about Cornwall Tech Week, but what is it?

The [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/uk) is a global movement where people from over 180 countries all have a go at an hour of code.  
The great thing about it is you don’t need to have any experience and there are lots of one hour tutorials available in over 30 languages!

The Hour of Code festival takes place between 7th and 13th December. So far 183,742 events are planned around the world- 2,333 of which are in the UK.

The tutorials are available on [code.org](https://uk.code.org/learn)  where you will find something for everyone, some titles include “Star Wars: Building a Galaxy with Code”, “Minecraft Hour of Code” and “Code with Anna and Elsa”

If you are interested in planning on organising an event you can find all the information [online](https://hourofcode.com/uk/how-to) with handy tips including suggesting you print certificates for your students or employees.

But why is there an Hour of Code? It was organised to help make computer science more available. It is an extremely important skill that is beneficial to everyone, not just people who want to be programmers!  
It is now part of the national curriculum in the UK yet we are seeing some teachers struggling with this new subject matter. [Code.org](https://code.org/),  along with other organisations like [Software Cornwall](http://www.softwarecornwall.org/), want to help them.

How much can you really learn in just one hour? Well its not going to make you an expert. However it is long enough to show you that coding is fun!  The Hour of Code isn’t set up to measure how much everyone has learnt, it is more about inclusion and getting people to “have a go”.

So what are you waiting for? Find out where your nearest hour of code is or set up your own event. Either way, get involved and have some fun.
