Our first beach BBQ of 2013 happened in May and to make this one a bit special we organised some surfing lessons as well as the usual yummy food.

Tom, a local surf instructor from [Breakers Surf School ](http://surf-lessons.co.uk/) joined us to teach the Headforwards team how to surf. The water was a little colder than expected and not many of the team opted to get in the water but got stuck into the BBQ whilst enjoying the warm spring sun.

The BBQ was a big hit as usual, providing some delicious steaks for the team along with some chicken, lamb and vegetarian options.

We took a few photos of the lovely surf and turf BBQ, which you can see below. If you want to view them as a slideshow, please just click on one of the images.
