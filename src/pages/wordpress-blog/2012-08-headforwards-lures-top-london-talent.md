Former [LoveFilm](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/bypost/storefront?node=3054240031) senior developer, [Aaron Trevena](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarontrevena), has taken up a new post with Headforwards, a recently established software development agency based in Cornwall.

Bringing over 12 years of experience to the role, Aaron will be working with the founders of Headforwards [Toby Parkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobyparkins) and [Craig Girvan](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/craiggirvan) to deliver world-class projects for an international client base, which includes companies such as telecommunications giant [NTT](http://www.ntt.com/index-e.html), and develop the business further.

His appointment as senior developer comes at a time when the IT sector in Cornwall is experiencing rapid growth and development as a result of the roll out of [superfast](http://www.superfastcornwall.org/) broadband in the county.  Speeds of up to 100Mbps are opening up new and challenging roles and attracting talent like Aaron, author and maintainer of 20 public Perl programming libraries, to the South West.

Commenting on his appointment, Aaron Trevena said:

_“I’m looking forward to the new professional opportunities this role will present. It’s an incredibly exciting time for the IT sector in Cornwall and we’re right at the forefront of industry developments. On a personal level, it’s also fantastic to have the opportunity to live and work in Cornwall, where I grew up. It’s great to be able to develop my career while living in a place which offers a brilliant lifestyle for my family.”_

Craig Girvan, director of Headforwards, added:

_“High quality software development requires very capable software engineers. So it’s fantastic that people like Aaron, who brings a wealth of expertise from roles at firms such as LoveFilm and Slando, are being attracted to Cornwall and new firms like ours, thanks to the state-of-the-art infrastructure being rolled out in the region.”_

If you would like to follow in Aaron’s footsteps and join the Headforwards team, please take a look at our [careers](http://www.headforwards.com/careers/) page. We may have the right position for you.
