On Tuesday 29th September 2015 we attended the [Cornwall Expo](http://www.ciosgrowthhub.com/news/article/13/2015/08/07/cornwall-expo-2015) at Newquay Airports [Aerohub](http://www.aerohub.co.uk/).  
The Expo combined a conference and exhibition to show the improvements planned for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly over the next few years.  
It was also an opportunity for people to learn more about schemes and initiatives in the county that are aimed at transforming and growing businesses, skills and tourism.

We attended the Expo with a few other members of [Software Cornwall](http://www.softwarecornwall.org/) and set up our stand in the skills zone.  Whilst we were there we talked to the delegates about the opportunities in the software sector as well as the work we are doing to try to fill the skills gap. It was great to speak to so many people who were engaged and excited about what we are trying to achieve. The 3D printer was a big hit, we had it programmed to print whistles and people were most surprised at how loud they were!

The Aerohub looked truly fantastic. We even had the opportunity to view the new Night Riviera sleeper carriages as well as the [Bloodhound](http://www.bloodhoundssc.com/) Super-Sonic Car!

The Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin  gave a [speech](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cornwall-expo-2015) about the investment in Cornwall’s Transport, which is worth a read if you get a chance.

The event was organised by the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Local Economic Partnership [(LEP)](http://www.cioslep.com/), [Cornwall Council](http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/) and the [Council of the Isles of Scilly](http://www.scilly.gov.uk/).
