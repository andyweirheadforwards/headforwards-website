bio: "Barney describes himself as a Software Mobster who loves a bit of TDD
  (Test-Driven Development). In his work at Headforwards he implements
  full-stack cloud-based solutions for corporate clients within the insurance
  sector, using TDD and mobbing which goes hand in hand with our Agile approach
  to delivering high quality software quickly and reliably. Outside of software
  development he enjoys tinkering with a soldering iron and a 3d printer but
  also loves running, sailing, cycling, photography, and getting wet, not
  necessarily in that order. "
