bio: "Peter studied Theoretical Physics at Swansea University and once had
  ambitions to go into particle physics. Since graduating he has completed a
  software development apprenticeship and worked as a data scientist and machine
  learning engineer before coming to Headforwards about a year ago. He has
  become interested in Agile, best development practices, testing, and business
  processes since starting at Headforwards, inspired by reading books suggested
  by other members of the team: The Unicorn Project, Joy Inc., and most recently
  Exponential Organizations. Outside work he loves staying fit. He is an avid
  runner, casual football player, and recently started maintaining an
  allotment."
