bio: Headforwards Co-Founders, Craig Girvan and Toby Parkins created the company
  on the belief that clients were short-changed by traditional outsource
  software development. Headforwards was a new kind of outsource company which
  left behind the ‘on the bench’ model and focused on the right people,
  dedicated teams and collaborative relationships. Now with more than 120 people
  in their team, Craig and Toby have created a company which delivers their
  clients real business value.
