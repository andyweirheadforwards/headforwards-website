The [Cornish Guardian](http://www.cornishguardian.co.uk/Cornwall-California-UK-named-second-UK-growth/story-28762944-detail/story.html) recently published the following article called: Cornwall becoming ‘California of the UK’ as it is named second in the UK for growth.

The county’s growing digital community was ranked second in the UK in terms of turnover growth, showing a 153 percent increase.

This was second only to Southampton on 180 percent and far exceeding London, which had 101 percent.

The 2016 Tech Nation report is produced by Government-funded program [Tech City](http://www.techcityuk.com/technation/) and innovation charity [Nesta](http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/tech-nation-2016), and charts the UK’s digital economy.

Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) said that growth in the digital economy was a key focus because of its potential to create high quality, well-paid,jobs.

According to the report, the clusters of tech business in places such as Truro, Camborne and Redruth are employing 1,38-0 staff and are contributing £31 million to the local economy every year.

The advertised average salary is £34,367 which is almost twice the average salary in Cornwall of £17, 340.

Paul Massey is a LEP board member and chairman of the LEP’s employment and skills board.  He is also director of Cornish digital business Bluefruit Software, which featured in the Tech Nation report.

Paul said:

_“Cornwall stands out in this report as the second highest growth area in the UK for digital industries and is fast becoming the California of the UK as the place to be for tech based businesses. _  
_Cornwall’s digital tech turnover grew 32 percent faster than the rest of the UK and a lot of this growth has been driven by the European Union funding available to support Cornish businesses, dramatically improved superfast connectivity, a highly collaborative tech community int he region, and improving the skills of the available workforce, which the LEP is determined to grow.”_

The 2016 Tech Nation report was complied with input from Software Cornwall, a network of local tech businesses with a key objective of improving the visibility and awareness of Cornwall’s tech industries cluster locally and nationally.

The report features local businesses such as [Headforwards](https://www.headforwards.com/), [Crowdfunder](http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/), [Sullivan Cuff](https://www.scslhealth.com/inrstar/contact/) and Bluefruit Software, as well as [Truro and Penwith College](http://www.truro-penwith.ac.uk/) and [Cornwall College](https://www.cornwall.ac.uk/).
