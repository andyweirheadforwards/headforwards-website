[Cornwall Tech Week](https://www.cornwalltechweek.org/) is fast approaching and we are getting rather excited!

Cornwall Tech Week is the brainchild of [Cornwall College](https://www.cornwall.ac.uk/) and [Software Cornwall](http://www.softwarecornwall.org/) – the idea was sparked from The Hour of Code.

[The Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/uk) is a global event that sees people all over the world engage in creating code for an hour. No experience is necessary and the workshops are aimed at anyone from the age of 4 upwards.  
The idea of Cornwall Tech Week was to take this idea and expand it, making a weeks worth of events.

The current schedule consists of:
