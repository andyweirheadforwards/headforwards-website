Every month at Headforwards we like to get together outside of the office and do something fun.  
After a summer of BBQs, topped off with our mini-festival – [Headstock](https://www.headforwards.com/2016/09/headstock-2016/) – we decided October was the right time to find a fun inside activity. This month we chose bowling.

Last night 45 of us, including some friends and family, went along to Truro Bowl, where we filled up 7 of the lanes for a really fun game. After bowling some of us went on for dinner at the Ganges, in Truro, to celebrate wins and carry on the evening over a brilliant curry.

Thank you Lyssa for organising a brilliant night and thanks to all who came along!
