Outsourcing your software development can be a tough decision to make and it can be even harder to know when it is the right time to make this jump. That is why we have put together this list to help you decide when to outsource your software development.

Project Costs
-------------

When you choose to outsource you know what your monthly fee will be. You will not be financially responsible for hiring, salaries or other overhead costs. It is extremely important not to choose a company just because they are the cheapest, you really do get what you pay for with software development.  You could end up with a poor quality product, have the projected costs increased dramatically and a lot of extra hassle. Take the time to look at the companies existing and previous clients as well as the projects they have worked on.

Skills
------

Your existing software team may have your current projects in hand but what happens when you need something creating that they don’t have the knowledge or skills for?

For example you might need a mobile app developing but your talented team don’t have the relevant experience to do this. Outsourcing this project to a team that is already skilled in that technology makes better business sense. It would be drastically quicker and cheaper than training your existing team and it would enable them to keep focused on their existing tasks

Partner
-------

Outsourcing doesn’t have to be an all or nothing solution. You can retain your existing software development team and outsource. If your developers are overloaded with projects and the backlog of requests is piling up, outsourcing some of the new projects would be a wise decision to make. It is important to let your current team know that they are still valued otherwise it is possible they might become despondent which is when their work will suffer.

Recruitment
-----------

Recruitment can be hard. You may find that after months of searching  you still cannot find the right person or people to join your team. This could be an indication that it is the right time to outsource some of your software development.  
Most outsource companies have teams of developers waiting “on the bench” ready to jump straight onto your projects.

Whilst it is great to get the ball moving so quickly you need to be aware that this will put their costs up. They have to pay those developers all year whether or not they are working.  
Here at [Headforwards](http://www.headforwards.com/what-we-do/) we approach this differently. We recruit developers specifically for individual projects putting together bespoke teams with the right skills needed.  This enables us to provide you with the best possible people creating the best possible software.

With whom?
----------

Now you know when to outsource your software development it is time to decide who you are going to partner with.  It is extremely important to find the right company. One who has proven that they can recruit, train and retain great developers.  
Company culture plays a big part in this, so take the time to get to know your potential partners. Visit their offices, speak to their developers and try to find out what makes them so successful.
