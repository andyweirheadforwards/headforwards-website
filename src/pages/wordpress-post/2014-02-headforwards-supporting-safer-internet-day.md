[Safer Internet Day](http://www.saferinternet.org/safer-internet-day) (SID) is organised by the joint [Insafe/INHOPE](http://www.saferinternet.org/insafe-inhope-resources) network, with the support of the European Commission each February to promote safer and more responsible use of online technology and mobile devices, especially among children and young people.

Celebrated on the second day of the second week of the second month, each year on Safer Internet Day hundreds of events are organised to raise awareness of online safety issues, right across the globe.

The online safety landscape has evolved over recent years from a focus on creating a ‘safer’ Internet to creating a ‘better’ Internet. This year’s Safer Internet Day theme, therefore, looks at the responsibility that we must all take in making the Internet a better place. Whether we are children or young people, parents or carers, educators or social care workers, or indeed industry, decision makers or politicians, we all have a role to play.

Headforwards supports the goals of Safer Internet Day and so we asked our team of software professionals for their views on how to make the Internet a better and safer place. Some of the advice was surprisingly simple. Mike, a senior developer, said:

“Turn your computer off when you’re not using it. This saves energy and protects you from hackers.”

And Anthony, a Perl expert, added:

“I think the easiest thing that people can do, that they often don’t do, that makes the most difference: Keep regular off-line backups of anything important. Test that the backups work every so often.”

Following the theme of straightforward technical advice, Tim, a business analyst, suggested:

“Make sure each computer has up-to-date virus, malware and firewall software. Some devices (such as set-top-box) cannot have any of the above installed, so ensure internet router has firewall enabled.”

Emily, a software team leader, offered some great advice on how to ensure children use the internet safely:

“Our kids are extremely heavy internet users, and have been since they were very young – we believe it is important for them to understand what is out there, and what they should and shouldn’t do on the net. They have guidelines as to what kind of things they can do, they all have their own email accounts and they all know not to give out their real names or any details about themselves to strangers. Most importantly, the computer they use is in the same room as us so we can keep half an eye on what they’re doing and call it out if we think they’re doing something unsafe.”

And Helen, a Perl programmer, added:

“I never let my children use the internet unsupervised, we never open unknown emails or unknown links, never download software from an unknown source, and never post personal information publicly.”

Glen, a User Experience expert, provided some simple guidelines for sharing personal information online:

“Anything you put on the internet will be remembered. If you don’t want people to know about something, don’t put it on the internet. Simply – “Would you show this to your mum, teacher, or someone you did not know?”
