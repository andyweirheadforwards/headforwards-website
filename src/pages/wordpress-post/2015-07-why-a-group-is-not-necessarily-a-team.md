You have an exciting and important new project on the table. So what is the first thing you do? Source 6 people, throw them together and expect them to be a highly productive team churning out quality work, right?

Perhaps this isn’t the best way.

In the software world developers need to work together as a team, and not just be a group of individuals who are working towards the same goal.  
This is why a linear team structure can sometimes be a hindrance.

Our experience using [Agile](http://www.agilealliance.org/the-alliance/what-is-agile/) and [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/Resources/What-is-Scrum) techniques teaches us that you need someone steering the ship to get the best performance from the team.

However Agile teams are self-managing and this is an important part of the process, but within that team there are a few key roles:  
Product Owner

Scrum Master

Technical Lead

Developers

The Product Owner is the big picture person. They have the vision of what needs to be accomplished and will liaise with the client or end user to make sure the project is delivering what they want. They will prioritise backlogs during sprints, and they are there to motivate the team with clear goals. If you are looking for someone to fulfil this role it is key that they have excellent communication skills.

The Scrum Master ensures that the team is on target by ensuring the process is working and that they are all on the same wavelength. They also liaise with the client, but it is their job to make sure the goals are realistic. Each sprint should produce a potentially shippable product, and the scrum master ensures this happens whilst clearing any blocks and managing cross team communications. If you are looking for someone to fulfil this role it is important to find someone who is assertive and great at building relationships.

The Technical Lead meets with the Project Owner and Scrum Master for some pre-sprint planning. They create a technical plan and help form the natural break down of work. They need to be good at explaining the technical aspects of tasks to people who may not have a deep understanding of the subject.

The developers set their own time and during the daily stand up  they discuss what has been accomplished since the last stand up and what they will be doing next. This is different to other project management methodologies, as usually you would expect a project manager to be setting the tasks. It is important to keep these stand ups short and to the point, which is one of the reasons they are done standing up! This is the time to talk about what you are doing, not how you are doing it.

In Agile the whole team works out the priorities and figures out how best to get the job done whilst collaborating closely with customer. Having only the Scrum Master and Product Owner speaking to the client is better than them speaking to all the developers individually where the message can get lost and people can end up bogged down in irrelevant information.

Being Agile helps keep all members of the team on target, and also flags up any issues or blockages swiftly so that they can be dealt with enabling a quality product getting to market quickly.

A group is full of individuals who share a common interest.

A team is task orientated, purposeful and involved in the same activity, together.

If you are interested in turning your group of developers into a team, try making them more [Agile.](http://www.headforwards.com/2015/06/what-is-agile/)
