    title: A dedicated team for every client
    text: "Headforwards is different from other software outsource companies – and a big part of that difference is the company’s approach to resourcing projects. \r\n\nAt Headforwards, each client has a dedicated team, hand-picked to meet the client’s specific needs, and in place for the long term. To ensure a great cultural fit and a great start to the relationship, clients are involved at every step of the team recruitment process.\r\n\nClose collaboration means clients and the team get to know each other better every day, resulting in a strong partnership, the opportunity to share skills and knowledge, and a high quality of delivered software."

      With tightly-crafted teams for every client, everyone builds strong
      relationships with each other – it makes the challenges easier to
      overcome, and the successes even bigger.

    title: 'High-performing teams, high-quality software'
    text: >-
      There can be a lot of difficult conversations during software development
      – which route to go down, which technique to use, or even which skills are
      needed on the team.


      But when there’s a strong bond between the individual team members and the
      client, finding the right solution becomes easier.

      It’s important everyone is trusted equally in our teams. The right mix of
      experiences and skills can generate some really exciting ideas – and it
      completely shapes the way the project runs.

      Working together is essential for team success at Headforwards. That’s why
      we encourage focusing on pair programming and mobbing – not only does it
      grow relationships, but also develops our skillsets at the same time.
