          Headforwards believes clients get the greatest business value from
          software outsourcing when development teams are empowered to make their
          own decisions; when they follow an Agile methodology.
    
    
          Our clients look to us to develop software that creates value but, in a
          rapidly changing business environment, what constitutes that value might
          change from one week to the next.
    
    
          Software can only continue to deliver business value if the development
          teams can adapt quickly and smoothly to changing client needs. A client
          relationship based on trust, transparency and collaboration combined with
          Agile working practices allows Headforwards to be able to respond to
          changes in a constructive way.

      If something changes in our client’s world, they've got to adapt, they've
      got to look for a new competitive advantage in their software and that’s
      always what we aim to deliver.

          The Agile Manifesto says quality software emerges from self-organising
          teams. That’s why there’s no management layer at Headforwards. Instead,
          decision-making responsibility lies with the team working on each client
          project.
    
    
          When team members feel empowered and engaged, they work to their full
          potential, and it shows in the quality of the software they deliver.

      We believe the team is greater than the sum of its parts. We want to
      empower everybody who works for us and maximise their contribution – and
      the client really benefits from that.
