        text: "Hackathons. Jams. ‘Ship-It’ and ‘FedEx’ days. These 24-hour
          ideas-generation and development sprints are run under many different
          names, but they all have the same goal: to come up with a novel
          solution to a challenge the business is facing. That can be anything
          from the smallest quality of life improvements for employees, right up
          to entirely new product or service concepts.\ 

          \r

          One of my clients, an insurance company, has held many of
          these over the years, and I’ve seen the value this experimental
          approach has for finding new ideas and overcoming old obstacles first
          hand. \r


          ## A proof of concept in a day


          \r

          The client in question receives a lot of letters, forms,
          claims and other documents through the post every day – both typed and
          handwritten. They’re all opened and sorted by hand, with workers
          scanning and uploading each document for manual classification. And
          for a document such as a claims form, that’s all before it’s even
          assessed for approval. As you can imagine, this is a hugely
          time-consuming task.


          \r

          Most businesses have a process that looks a lot like this.
          Something that takes hours of repetitive work, but could be much
          simpler. In larger businesses, there can be loads of these manual
          processes, taking up resources that could be spent better almost
          anywhere else.


          \r

          When the client announced a Ship-It day was coming – named
          for its focus on getting a proof of concept ‘ready to ship’ in one day
          – I knew that this challenge was the one I wanted to focus on. I spent
          my 24 hours using TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning
          platform, to create a neural network that could classify documents
          automatically. It was based on a simple idea: that different document
          types have recognisable characteristics that a machine can use to
          identify them, without needing to see individual pieces of
          information. For example, all claims forms might use a specific layout
          that includes an account number and a list of other personal
          details.\r


          The proof of concept I produced could classify 10 different
          types of documents with a high degree of initial accuracy – a
          percentage that would only grow as the system processed and learned
          from more documents. I then built a website where users submit a
          scanned document for the neural network to classify.\r\n"

          I was aiming to create a simple, elegant fix for an
          inefficient process. My idea won that year’s challenge, and I
          presented the solution to leadership with some extra ideas for where
          the project could go next.


          \r

          It could be incorporated into an app. Optical character
          recognition could provide the next stage in reading and analysing the
          document. Added automation could give customers an app where they
          simply take a photo of their claim with their phone camera, submit it,
          and get approved within seconds. With the right application, this
          simple project could free up workers to focus on more complex tasks,
          improving efficiency, job satisfaction, and customer experiences all
          in one go.


          \r

          My client holds these 24-hour challenges frequently, and
          I’ve participated in more of them over the past few years, using the
          constraints as an opportunity to explore ways to make users’ lives
          easier and solve business problems.


          \r

          ## Cultures of experimentation


          \r

          You may associate these kinds of rapid-fire challenges with
          super-agile startups and the major tech companies, but there’s real
          value to playing around with what technology can do, whatever your
          size and focus.


          \r

          For some organisations, this community-driven approach,
          which often lacks structure beyond the time constraint, will rely on
          changing the way they view experimenting and reinventing. Many
          businesses follow that classic ‘if it ain’t broke…’ line of thinking.
          If a process is in place and it works, there’s no point in changing
          it, even if it’s inefficient or overly complicated.


          \r

          But that means they can be missing out on ways to make those
          processes faster, more profitable, or more rewarding for their
          employees. The beauty of a challenge like a Ship-It day is that it
          opens up clever, workable solutions that you might never have found
          otherwise.


          \r

          I’m very fortunate to work with a client that embraces an
          experimental, bottom-up approach to problem solving – and it’s time
          more companies followed that lead.\r\n"

        text: "My proof of concept came from a very simple starting place: I hate
          boring, repetitive tasks. And I knew that was a sentiment shared by
          workers the world over. All I needed was an opportunity to turn that
          everyday frustration into a potential solution.


          \r

          Give your people that opportunity – even if they’re not
          coders or software developers – and the results might pleasantly
          surprise you. The people within an organisation know the challenges
          and individual quirks of the business better than anyone, which makes
          them better placed than anyone else to think up a solution.
