        A lot has been written about agile methodology and the role of Scrum
        Master. Being a Scrum Master requires a wide range of interpersonal and
        facilitator skills. While there are a set of principles that Scrum
        Masters typically adhere to, everybody has their own take on the
        practice. We asked three of our own to talk about their focal points
        when practising the art of Scrum. 


        This is the second in a series where Headforwards Scrum Masters reveal insights into their role. Scrum Master, Craig Girvan talks about his take on the role.

        text: "## You have to think like a psychologist \r

          \r

          Psychology is the science of mind and behaviour. Group
          psychology in particular is very relevant to being a scrum master. You
          do not have to have a psychology degree but you do need to think like
          a psychologist. Be detached, be observant and aim to understand why
          people are acting the way they are. Look at the empirical evidence.
          Ultimately, the role of a scrum master is about bringing talented
          people together and enabling effective teams. This is down to human
          interaction and building trusting relationships. To make this happen,
          you have to have a high degree of observation and a keen interest in
          understanding people’s motivations. \r

          \r

          ## Keep upping your game \r

          \r

          Learning and continuous improvement should be at the heart
          of a Scrum Master’s approach. This includes consciously seeking out
          sources of new insights and knowledge – and using these fresh insights
          to challenge yourself and grow. So, for example, at Headforwards we
          organise sessions to explore and discuss great books like ‘Scrum
          Mastery. From Good to Great – Servant Leadership’ and we have given
          all scrum masters a subscription to Medium.com. This is to foster a
          culture of continuous learning and self-improvement.\ 


          # Stay alert to change \r

          \r

          Everything is changing all the time. What was true yesterday
          is already wrong today. Nothing stays still. There is no room for
          preconceptions, fixed opinions or closed minds. As situations and
          events change, you have to constantly adapt. But you can only do that
          if you are hyperalert to exactly what changes are happening and if you
          have a mindset which sees change as an opportunity not a threat.  \r

          \r

          Every situation and every individual is different, so you
          have to work hard to stay alert to subtle changes. This is especially
          true at Headforwards, where we love diversity and have incredibly
          diverse teams. \r


          ## Discover the value of self-reflection \r

          \r

          It is vital that a Scrum Master continually strives to learn
          from experience. But in order to learn from experience, you need to
          have the ability to detach and objectively observe and consider your
          own behaviours and actions. This is easier said than done. However, it
          is only through this kind of self- reflection that you can learn from
          experience.  A Scrum Master should habitually ask themselves questions
          such as: Could I have handled that situation better? What would have
          been the outcome if I had acted in a different way? Why did I do that?
          What can I learn from that experience which means I can be more
          effective next time?"

        text: "## See everyone as a human being, not just a co-worker \r

          \r

          Teams are made up of human beings, with all the complex
          issues we all have to deal with in our everyday lives – sometimes
          joyous, sometimes stressful or traumatic. Work is only part of the
          whole for anyone. And you can only really get the best out of someone
          in a work environment if you are also conscious of and sensitive to
          the myriad of other factors that may be influencing them or having an
          impact on their performance. Allow the humans to come to work, not
          just the professional facade.  As a Scrum Master you should take an
          interest in the whole person, not only their work persona. A Scrum
          Master should see their role as helping everyone in their team to live
          their best life – not just deliver work. That way, they will bring out
          the best in everyone.


          ## It’s not about you \r

          \r

          The art of a good scrum master is to do themselves out of a
          job. It is about being the catalyst that empowers your team to perform
          at its best. There is no place for ego. Do not fall into the trap of
          telling people what to do. Ask open-ended questions. Encourage people
          to think for themselves.\ 


          ## Assume good intent \r

          \r

          The vast majority of people have good intentions– but
          communications are fallible. It is always far too easy to misinterpret
          what someone means and see it as being negative, critical or
          threatening, when in fact that was not what they intended. This is
          especially true in communications such as texts and emails. One simple
          way of avoiding this trap is to always assume that someone has
          positive intentions in what they are saying or doing. OK, they may not
          be executing it in the best possible way – but if you remind yourself
          that their intentions are good, this will stop you going off on a
          negative spiral and it will mean that you can focus on the positive. "
