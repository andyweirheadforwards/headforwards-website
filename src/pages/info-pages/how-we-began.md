    title: The spark of a business idea
    text: "Headforwards might never have existed if it weren’t for a chance conversation at a barbecue. \rAgile practitioner Toby Parkins was talking with a product owner from a global corporation when the discussion turned to the difficulty of getting really good outsource developers.\r\n\n“He was talking about how you never get the right people, and how outsource companies just pull anyone off the bench to work on a project,” says Toby. “I knew instantly that I could put together a brilliant team for him – and the whole concept of Headforwards was founded in that moment.”"

    title: A new kind of software outsource company
    text: "Toby took the idea to Craig Girvan – a fellow Agile practitioner – who had been thinking down similar lines. \n\nThey agreed that clients were short-changed by traditional outsourcers, who tend to prioritise their own business over that of their clients. \rThey sketched out a vision of a new kind of outsource company, built on three principles:"

      It’s about picking the right people for each client, rather than running a
      bench. It may be slightly less efficient for us, but the client gets much
      better quality and value – and that’s what matters.

      We wanted to create teams that would be with the client for the long-term,
      so their knowledge could build up and be shared and retained.

      We wanted to involve clients in picking their teams, and to be transparent
      with them about our cost model. It makes for a much more productive and
      trusting relationship.

    title: Staying true to its principles
    text: "As clients increasingly look for outsource companies that deliver long-term value and competitive differentiation, Headforwards stands in good stead for the future. \r\n\n“Everything about our business is modelled around what a client could want. As long as we stay true to that, Headforwards will continue to grow.”"
