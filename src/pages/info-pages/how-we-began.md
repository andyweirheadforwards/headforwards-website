      - text: "Toby took the idea to Craig Girvan – a fellow Agile practitioner – who had been thinking down similar lines. \n\nThey agreed that clients were short-changed by traditional outsourcers, who tend to prioritise their own business over that of their clients. \rThey sketched out a vision of a new kind of outsource company, built on three principles:"

      It’s about picking the right people for each client, rather than running a
      bench. It may be slightly less efficient for us, but the client gets much
      better quality and value – and that’s what matters.

    title: The right people

      We wanted to create teams that would be with the client for the long-term,
      so their knowledge could build up and be shared and retained.

    title: Dedicated teams
  - quote: >-
      We wanted to involve clients in picking their teams, and to be transparent
      with them about our cost model. It makes for a much more productive and
      trusting relationship.

      - text: "As clients increasingly look for outsource companies that deliver long-term value and competitive differentiation, Headforwards stands in good stead for the future. \r\n\n“Everything about our business is modelled around what a client could want. As long as we stay true to that, Headforwards will continue to grow.”"
