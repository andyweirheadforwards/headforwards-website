      Employee wellbeing is hot on the agenda for Headforwards.  That’s why so
      much effort is put into organising social and community-orientated
      activities that benefit people both inside and outside the organisation. 


      Photos of Headforwards are just as likely to show the founding partners
      cooking at a barbecue or someone raising a glass of ‘Devhops’ – the
      companies own home-brew – as coding at their computer.


      The annual highlight of these events is Headstock, their own mini-festival
      – a whole weekend in the summer where friends and family are invited to
      camp and eat great food in the heart of the Cornish countryside.

      Headforwards has events going on all the time, and they’re not just for
      employees. We can bring our friends and family along to a wide range of
      activities which appeal to everyone.

      It’s no secret that people who feel looked after and valued are more
      likely to excel and do better work. The fact that the nearest beach is
      only 5 miles away probably does no harm to people’s outlook either.


      But it’s the company’s culture of openness and regular communication that
      underpins its entire operation – and makes its work so valuable to
      clients.
  - quote: >-
      Headforwards’ directors talk to every employee on a regular basis to check
      if any improvements can be made, get any suggestions they have for the
      company, or simply to offer general support.

      Headforwards’ people never stop learning. Aside from being able to draw on
      a wealth of knowledge in the office, employees have access to a wide range
      of training resources, conferences, and regular sessions on specific
      topics. 


      It’s an important part of life at the company because the more knowledge
      and experience the team develops, the better it can serve its clients.

      In addition to wide-ranging learning resources, we also have the
      opportunity to attend industry conferences like Agile on the Beach. It’s
      just another way we constantly improve our combined knowledge to benefit
      our clients.
