This is how you know the software will be of genuine value to your overall business strategy.\n\nWhen a project begins with challenges to overcome and clear goals to accomplish, the result is always more valuable. That’s why Headforwards creates software with the client’s overall business objectives in mind.\r\n\nThat said, the people at Headforwards know that software development is rarely straightforward. That’s why they work closely with clients throughout the duration of a project to ensure the end result creates the most value for their business."

      There’s no point creating software that doesn’t deliver value to the

      produce will really help them reach their goals.

        text: "Headforwards’ teams embed themselves in the business they’re working with at the start of every project. It’s the best way to ensure they can understand and meet the client’s needs every step of the way. \r\n\nAgile principles are tightly integrated to the development lifecycle, which means teams can develop each iteration fast, and adapt quickly as requirements change."
  - quote: >-
      In most cases, our clients’ requirements never stay the same throughout
      the entire project—and we embrace that. Using Agile principles, we’re able
      to ensure the software we’re delivering always has genuine value to the
      business.

    title: How we measure value
    content:
      - type: markdown-component
        text: "As an integral part of the client’s team, it’s easy for Headforwards to measure the value created and monitor a project’s success.\r\n\nThat’s why development is often just the start. Headforwards’ teams stay with clients after deployment to measure their impact, identifying metrics like usage, user experience and stability, and updating software when needed."
