        text: "## Get under the skin of your teams \r

          \r

          I came from a traditional Project Manager background and I
          have learnt to let go of old habits and old ways of relating to
          people. Being a Scrum Master involves the delivery aspects of project
          management, but at its best, it is much more than that. It is enabling
          teams to be the best they can be. To make that happen, you have to
          relate to all the individual team members with  genuine sincerity. You
          have to try to get under the skin of your staff and really understand
          what makes them tick, taking into account individual personality
          traits and any sensitivities or barriers which may for example make
          people defensive or hold them back. Pulling a team together is
          difficult and you can only do it when you have a deep understanding of
          every team member.\ 


          ## Be sincere \r

          \r

          Be sincere and authentic in the way you relate to your team
          and colleagues. People instantly recognise sincerity and respond to
          it. It is probably the most important personal characteristic for a
          Scrum Master to have as it has an immediate and powerful impact on the
          way others relate to you. \r

          \r

          ## Watch your language \r

          \r

          As an Agile Scrum Master, it is vital that you avoid any of
          the language of old-style management or hierarchical structures. You
          should  endeavour not to issue blunt instructions or tell the team
          what they have to do. At the heart of your approach, should be a
          commitment to Agile Coaching. Work with the team and encourage them.
          This will show up in the kind of language you use. For example, you
          should always say ‘This is the team I work with’ rather than call them
          ‘My team’. The differences may seem subtle but it creates an
          atmosphere of mutual respect and builds the team’s confidence. In the
          same vein, tone of voice matters too. As quite a passionate person by
          nature, this is something I have had to learn and cultivate. It never
          helps to raise your voice or get too strident. Stay cool, calm and
          measured. \r


          ## Develop the relationship over time \r

          \r

          Phase the relationship with your team. For example,
          initially you may say ‘you can be open with me.’ After trust and
          respect has built up across the team, you may later go on to say: ‘You
          can say whatever you like to me – if you tell me to get lost, I am a
          happy man.’ However, had you said that at the very outset, there is a
          risk that some team members could go too far and potentially offend
          other members of the team. It is a subtle line to draw – but you
          should regard the relationship with your team as one that grows and
          deepens over time, as you get to know each other. \r

          \r

          ## Discover the power of silence \r

          \r

          Learn when to hold back and stay quiet. There is a human
          tendency to want to leap in and fill the silence if there is a pause
          in a conversation. But as a Scrum Master, it is usually more fruitful
          to stay quiet and let someone else speak up. Get comfortable with long
          pauses – they are not there for you to fill! Let your team members
          have the opportunity to say what they think. This is particularly
          important with less experienced team members, who may be reticent and
          who need to grow in confidence. So learn how to ask the right
          questions and learn when to sit back silently and listen. In some
          meetings, I say nothing at all. \r

          \r

          ## Hire the right people for your company’s ethos \r

          \r

          Although you can train people and teach them new skills, you
          cannot change a person’s essential  character and personality. Make
          sure you recruit people that share the same ethos as your company and
          reflect the characteristics prized by your organisation. That way, it
          will be a win-win. \r

          \r\r

          ## Encourage your team to connect on a personal level \r

          \r

          Every team will have loads of issues going on. The team will
          work better together if they understand each other. Simple tools and
          techniques can help, such as each sharing with each other ‘I like it
          when….’ Or ‘I don’t like it when….. This kind of simple device can
          quickly unlock some deeper insights and understanding and help the
          team to work well together. \r

          \r

          ## Treat everyone exactly the same \r

          \r

          Treat everyone as a peer and  treat everyone with equal
          respect and generosity of spirit, whether they are the most junior
          person in the company or the owner of the company. Respect others and
          you will soon win the respect of others. "
