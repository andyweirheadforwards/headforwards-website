          A client may look to Headforwards to build a dedicated
          off-site team for a number of reasons. They may need extra resource
          but not have the physical space available to co-locate. They may wish
          to explore the benefits of an Agile methodology without transforming
          their existing enterprise. They may start with limited budget to prove
          what’s possible, before bringing more specialist expertise into the
          project – all of these can be resolved by using an Augmented Team with
          Headforwards.  "

        quote: Augmented teams can be a brilliant way for clients to optimise their
          budgets through flexible resourcing, only bringing in specialist
          expertise as and when it’s needed.

        text: "Dedicated teams are not only hired in collaboration with clients, they
          also work in close collaboration. Daily stand-ups and continuous
          transparency through digital kanban boards and living documentation,
          ensure that progress is visible and delivery is on-track. Continuous
          delivery ensures the team can deploy new work rapidly and be
          responsive, while maintaining stability in the software. \r

          \r

          Some organisations want to move to an Agile approach, but
          legacy processes and modes of software development get in the way. By
          partnering with Headforwards, large organisations can immediately
          benefit from its Agile approach to software development; something
          that can be hard to achieve in-house. \r

          \r

          Close collaboration means clients and the team get to know
          each other better every day, resulting in a strong partnership, the
          opportunity to share skills and knowledge, and ultimately quality,
          valuable software delivered. "

          * Incremental growth – prove value to your stakeholders, before progressing to more team members

          * Flexible resourcing - additional skills available, at short notice  


          This client-focussed approach makes working with Headforwards as attractive to CTOs and CIOs in corporations and organisations as it is to entrepreneurs and start-ups.
