      | _hjClosedSurveyInvites  \t| Hubspot  \t| 365 days  \t| Hotjar
      cookie that is set once a visitor interacts with an External Link Survey
      invitation modal. It is used to ensure that the same invite does not
      reappear if it has already been shown.  \t|\r

      | _hjDonePolls  \t| Hubspot  \t| 365 days  \t| Hotjar cookie that is
      set once a visitor completes a survey using the On-site Survey widget. It
      is used to ensure that the same survey does not reappear if it has already
      been filled in.  \t|\r

      | _hjMinimizedPolls  \t| Hubspot  \t| 365 days  \t| Hotjar cookie
      that is set once a visitor minimizes an On-site Survey widget. It is used
      to ensure that the widget stays minimized when the visitor navigates
      through your site.  \t|\r

      | _hjShownFeedbackMessage  \t| Hubspot  \t| 365 days  \t| Hotjar
      cookie that is set when a visitor minimizes or completes Incoming
      Feedback. This is done so that the Incoming Feedback will load as
      minimized immediately if the visitor navigates to another page where it is
      set to show.  \t|\r

      | _hjid  \t| Hubspot  \t| 365 days  \t| Hotjar cookie that is set
      when the customer first lands on a page with the Hotjar script. It is used
      to persist the Hotjar User ID, unique to that site on the browser. This
      ensures that behavior in subsequent visits to the same site will be
      attributed to the same user ID.  \t|\r

      | _hjRecordingLastActivity  \t| Hubspot  \t| Session  \t| This
      should be found in Session storage (as opposed to cookies). This gets
      updated when a visitor recording starts and when data is sent through the
      WebSocket (the visitor performs an action that Hotjar records).  \t|\r

      | _hjTLDTest  \t| Hubspot  \t| Session  \t| When the Hotjar script
      executes we try to determine the most generic cookie path we should use,
      instead of the page hostname. This is done so that cookies can be shared
      across subdomains (where applicable). To determine this, we try to store
      the _hjTLDTest cookie for different URL substring alternatives until it
      fails. After this check, the cookie is removed.  \t|\r

      | _hjUserAttributesHash  \t| Hubspot  \t| Session  \t| User
      Attributes sent through the Hotjar Identify API are cached for the
      duration of the session in order to know when an attribute has changed and
      needs to be updated.  \t|\r

      | _hjCachedUserAttributes  \t| Hubspot  \t| Session  \t| This cookie
      stores User Attributes which are sent through the Hotjar Identify API,
      whenever the user is not in the sample. These attributes will only be
      saved if the user interacts with a Hotjar Feedback tool.  \t|\r

      | _hjLocalStorageTest  \t| Hubspot  \t| Under 100ms  \t| This cookie
      is used to check if the Hotjar Tracking Script can use local storage. If
      it can, a value of 1 is set in this cookie. The data stored
      in_hjLocalStorageTest has no expiration time, but it is deleted almost
      immediately after it is created.  \t|\r

      | _hjIncludedInPageviewSample  \t| Hubspot  \t| 30 minutes  \t| This
      cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that visitor is included in the
      data sampling defined by your site's pageview limit.  \t|\r

      | _hjIncludedInSessionSample  \t| Hubspot  \t| 30 minutes  \t| This
      cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that visitor is included in the
      data sampling defined by your site's daily session limit.  \t|\r

      | _hjAbsoluteSessionInProgress  \t| Hubspot  \t| 30 Minutes  \t|
      This cookie is used to detect the first pageview session of a user. This
      is a True/False flag set by the cookie.  \t|\r

      | NA  \t| Google Ads  \t| NA  \t| Cited from Google's own policy
      wording:  We use cookies to make advertising more engaging to users and
      more valuable to publishers and advertisers. Some common applications of
      cookies are to select advertising based on what’s relevant to a user; to
      improve reporting on campaign performance; and to avoid showing ads the
      user has already seen.  Google uses cookies like NID and SID to help
      customize ads on Google properties, like Google Search. For example, we
      use such cookies to remember your most recent searches, your previous
      interactions with an advertiser’s ads or search results, and your visits
      to an advertiser’s website. This helps us to show you customized ads on
      Google.  We also use one or more cookies for advertising we serve across
      the web. One of the main advertising cookies on non-Google sites is named
      ‘IDE‘ and is stored in browsers under the domain doubleclick.net. Another
      is stored in google.com and is called ANID. We use other cookies with
      names such as DSID, FLC, AID, TAID, and exchange_uid. Other Google
      properties, like YouTube, may also use these cookies to show you more
      relevant ads.  Sometimes advertising cookies may be set on the domain of
      the site you’re visiting. In the case of advertising we serve across the
      web, cookies (e.g., cookies named ‘__gads’ or ‘__gac’) may be set on the
      domain of the site you’re visiting. Unlike cookies that are set on
      Google’s own domains, these cookies can’t be read by Google when you’re on
      a site other than the one on which they were set. They serve purposes such
      as measuring interactions with the ads on that domain and preventing the
      same ads from being shown to you too many times.  Google also uses
      conversion cookies (e.g., cookies named ‘__gcl’), whose main purpose is to
      help advertisers determine how many times people who click on their ads
      end up taking an action on their site (e.g., making a purchase). These
      cookies allow Google and the advertiser to determine that you clicked the
      ad and later visited the advertiser’s site. Conversion cookies are not
      used by Google for personalized ad targeting and persist for a limited
      time only. Some of our other cookies may be used to measure conversion
      events as well. For example, Google Marketing Platform and Google
      Analytics cookies may also be used for this purpose.  We also use cookies
      named ‘AID,‘ ‘DSID,’ and ‘TAID‘, which are used to link your activity
      across devices if you’ve previously signed in to your Google Account on
      another device. We do this to coordinate the ads you see across devices
      and measure conversion events. These cookies may be set on the domains
      google.com/ads, google.com/ads/measurement, or googleadservices.com. If
      you don't want the ads you see to be coordinated across your devices, you
      can opt out of Ads Personalization using Ads Settings.  \t|\r
