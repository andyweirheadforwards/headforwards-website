    text: "That’s why Headforwards is always looking for the perfect fit – for our clients and for our culture.   \n\nHeadforwards is a software business. But first and foremost, it’s a people business. \n\n\rIn its Cornwall offices, a fast-growing team contributes to an open and honest culture where everyone has their voice heard—and where working well together is the number one priority. \rThis is ‘the Headforwards type’: a team player. And it’s a team that’s always looking to grow."

    name: Marie Ashton

      There are no egos here. Team fit is the most important thing, so the
      people we hire need to be really positive and prepared to have each
      other’s backs.

    title: Round pegs in round holes
    text: "Headforwards was founded on the principle of recruiting the right team for each client. Rather than go it alone, it gets clients involved in the process, so everyone is confident from the start that the right people are on board.\r\n\nAnd when those people are on board, Headforwards makes sure they always feel engaged and fulfilled in their work. That’s why the company has such a high staff retention rate, and why it’s able to build such strong and lasting partnerships with clients."
  - quote: >-
      We want to make sure our people feel completely at home where they are.
      That applies equally to the projects they’re working on and the experience
      of being here in general—we even help our employees choose the best place
      to live if they’re relocating.

    title: Putting family first
    text: "Happy people are more engaged at work, which is why Headforwards places so much emphasis on ensuring its staff, and the people around them, are well looked after. \r\n\nThat’s one reason you’re more likely to see Headforwards employees at one of the company’s many social events than burning the midnight oil. And it’s why Headforwards goes above and beyond to help its people feel right at home when relocating to Cornwall.    \n\n\rIt’s all about doing valuable work, in a beautiful place, for appreciative clients. With a ready-made social life just waiting to be enjoyed."
  - quote: >-
      We do a lot to try and make sure our people and their families are
      happy—from helping them integrate into Cornish life to organising regular
      social events, like our annual ‘Headstock’ festival.
