      There are no egos here. Team fit is the most important thing, so the
      people we hire need to be really positive and prepared to have each
      other’s backs.

      We want to make sure our people feel completely at home where they are.
      That applies equally to the projects they’re working on and the experience
      of being here in general—we even help our employees choose the best place
      to live if they’re relocating.

      We do a lot to try and make sure our people and their families are
      happy—from helping them integrate into Cornish life to organising regular
      social events, like our annual ‘Headstock’ festival.
