          People often think that it is really expensive to live in Cornwall.
          Yes, there are lots of people who have second homes here, and yes the
          cost of housing is increasing. It is true that in some areas local
          people struggle to buy, but isn't that the case everywhere? 


          Living on the sea front in St Ives or Falmouth is pretty pricey, but
          there are plenty of houses in other coastal towns and villages which
          are very reasonable. Houses a bit further inland can be even cheaper
          to rent and to buy. 


          Housing close to our office is very reasonable and it is still only 4
          miles from the beach.

          I was paying £1200 a month for a 1 bed flat in Wembley. I'm moving to
          Cornwall for a higher salary and I can rent a really nice 3 bed house
          for £850 a month I had no idea
