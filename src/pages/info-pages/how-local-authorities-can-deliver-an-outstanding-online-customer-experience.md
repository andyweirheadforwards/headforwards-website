      text: "In our day to day lives, we are all used to interacting with a wide range
        of brands and service providers, from online retailers to banks, utility
        providers and much more. Many of these deliver an excellent online
        customer experience. This, in turn, shapes citizens’ expectations of
        their local authority. People increasingly expect their council to
        provide services quickly and efficiently, using the online technology
        which makes their lives as easy as possible.\r


        With the huge variety of services that councils are responsible
        for, and the complex range of customers that they deal with, this
        represents a tough challenge. Luckily, advances in technology mean that
        there are many innovative new ways to deliver these services, creating a
        customer experience that can match anything seen in the commercial
        sector. \r


        Using the right digital technology, local councils can deliver a
        much more responsive service to their customers which also enables
        greater productivity. These systems can improve the quality of feedback
        to the council and the data gathered on its customers, which can guide
        the long-term improvement of local authority services.\r\n"

    title: What makes a great customer experience?
    content:
      - type: markdown-component
        text: "These are the key requirements that need to be met when designing the
          online customer experience for local authorities:


          * **Ease of use**. People expect digital systems that make
          their lives as easy as possible and are very straightforward to
          navigate. Bear in mind that many of the people using these systems
          will be relatively inexperienced with using technology, so they must
          be helped along the way.\r

          * **Customer-centred**. People want to be able to access all
          the information they need through one point of access rather than
          having to deal with different departments. This requires a carefully
          planned and ‘joined up’ approach.\r

          * **Self-service**. If they are given the right systems,
          then more and more customers will be happy to take the initiative in
          seeking out the support they need. This in turn frees up council staff
          time to focus on added value activities. As part of this, customers
          expect to have their own user account, which gathers all their
          important information in one place and highlights any important
          actions that need to be taken.\r

          * **Speed**. Customers want to be able to get fast access to
          the precise information they need. Any frustration with this will lead
          to them picking up the phone, which would tie up unnecessary
          resources.\r

          * **Personalisation**. Customers want to be able to decide
          when and how they receive information from their council. They also
          want their customer journey to be personalised, based on their latest
          information, and using data provided from their previous interactions.
          Improved personalisation also means that customers are only sent
          communications that are relevant to their particular needs.\r

          * **Availability**. Customers want to be able to use the
          council systems 24/7. This convenience means they can schedule their
          dealings with the council around their work and home commitments. It
          also means that productivity is maintained even out of hours. As with
          any key service provider, downtime needs to be kept to a minimum.\r

          * **Consistency**. Whatever part of the council system
          people are interacting with, they need to feel that they are getting a
          consistent experience and that the council is speaking to them with
          ‘one voice.’ If you think of the council as a brand, then this
          consistency and reliability is an important way in which brands build
          trust with their customers. \r

          * **Flexibility**. Customers expect to have a lot of options
          open to them for communicating with their council, including email,
          text, social media, and even specially designed apps.\r

          * **Real-time interactions**. Customers want to be sure they
          are always accessing the very latest information and that the system
          is automatically updated with their latest inputs.\r

          * **Security**. With the large amount of information that
          councils hold on their customers, it is vital that the system has
          excellent security and that customers are confident about the safety
          of their data, as well as that all personal data complies with the
          GDPR.\r

    title: The impact of AI and automation
    content:
      - type: markdown-component
        text: "Given the complexity of the above requirements, and the growing demands
          of customers, it is not surprising that [AI and automation are
          beginning to make an
          impact](https://www.headforwards.com/insights/why-artificial-intellig\
          ence-has-the-power-to-transform-the-work-of-local-authorities/) on the
          way that councils deliver their customer experience.\r


          A great example of this trend is the increased use of
          chatbots and digital assistants. Chatbots have already been deployed
          across a wide range of consumer services and have now gained much
          wider acceptance. They can be especially valuable in dealing with
          services that generate a large volume of enquiries which are also
          highly repetitive in nature. They can be invaluable when there is a
          need to deal with a sudden spike in demand which would otherwise tie
          up a large number of human agents, who even then might not be able to
          cope with the increased volume.\r


          This is another way in which customers can be encouraged to
          self-serve, while also providing a highly responsive level of service.
          The latest customer information can be drawn across from the back
          office system in order to personalise these conversations. This
          technology does not do away with human involvement, but this can be
          held in reserve for particularly complex enquiries, ensuring the most
          appropriate use of the available council resources.\r


          These AI-driven systems will have an increasing influence on
          the way in which councils deliver their customer experience across all
          their different channels, and will enable a very sophisticated level
          of personalisation.\r\n"

    title: Taking a strategic approach
    content:
      - type: markdown-component
        text: "To deliver an outstanding customer experience councils need to develop a
          detailed understanding of all the customer journeys that are made and
          how these affect each individual’s interactions with the council.\r


          For these technologies to operate effectively, there needs
          to be a fully integrated front-end and back-end Business Intelligence
          system, which can draw the information needed efficiently while also
          continually updating with the latest data on each customer – and all
          operating in real time.\r


          This may well require a radical re-think of the existing IT
          set-up and a thorough review of the relevance of the existing legacy
          systems. This will require some bold decision making.\r


          **The long-term benefits of this approach are that it:\r**


          * Ensures that customers enjoy a smooth and efficient
          interaction whenever they deal with the council\r

          * Enables the council to manage a complex range of
          services\r

          * Frees up staff time to spend on more added value
          activities\r

          * Can evolve and grow to meet the changing needs of the
          council and its customers\r

          * Provides a more impressive showcase for all the services
          offered by the council\r


          Delivering a quality customer experience has a big influence
          on how residents view the overall performance of their council, how
          engaged they are, and how satisfied they feel with local
          democracy.\r\n"
