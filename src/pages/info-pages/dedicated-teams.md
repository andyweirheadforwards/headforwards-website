        text: "Our dedicated teams can be self-contained delivery teams that provide or
          extend any in-house capability, or they can become an extension of
          existing teams, augmented with specific skillsets as needed. \r

          \ \r

          A core aspect of the Headforwards approach to building a
          dedicated team or teams is that the client is an integral part of the
          recruitment process. This is truly a long-term partnership solution.
          These teams will be actively involved in understanding their clients
          technical and business roadmaps and will be focused on those goals for
          the long term.\r

          \ \r

          Because these dedicated teams are also an integral part of
          Headforwards, clients benefit from all the knowledge sharing and
          working practices that are a part of our philosophy; an Agile approach
          to development, techniques such as pair and mob programming and our
          internal knowledge sharing and communities of practice events.\r"

        quote: When clients and teams work closely together, communication becomes much
          easier. Our developers feel confident approaching the client with
          issues, and the client isn’t afraid to tell us if we’re going down the
          wrong path.

          although we have also built teams that focus on other areas of
          business such as Customer Service and Product Management. \r

          \ \r

          Our belief in the value of dedicated teams and our ability
          to recruit and manage them to exceed client’s expectations is what
          lies at the core of Headforwards’ reputation in software
          development.\r\n"
