          Different clients look for different things from an outsource software
          partner. Headforwards offers two engagement models to ensure you get
          the right mix of quality and value for money. 


          Headforwards was founded on the belief that clients are short-changed
          by traditional software outsource companies – mainly due to the
          “on-the-bench” model of project resourcing.

          When you just pull whoever’s available off the bench to work on a
          client project, there’s no continuity, no knowledge retention, and no
          foundation of trust. Quality often suffers, and outsourcing can become
          a false economy.

          Headforwards has deliberately avoided that out-moded model. Instead,
          it focuses on forming effective teams who stay together long-term and
          continuously develop new ways to deliver value to the client.


          Companies can choose to engage Headforwards in one of two ways: as a
          long-term partner or for a short-term project.

          The cloud has made continuous delivery the norm, so many clients are
          looking for long-term, ongoing and cost-effective support from their
          outsource partner. 


          For this kind of engagement, Headforwards works with the client to
          recruit the team, so everyone is confident the right people are on
          board, and a strong bond forms from the start.

          Not every organisation is looking for a long-term partnership. Some
          want to outsource a discrete short-term project, like a prototype,
          proof of concept or app. 


          Headforwards has formed a special projects team for short-term
          engagements, who will bring together the right people to deliver each
          project.

      It’s all about getting the right team on to the project. While we have two
      models in place, there’s still room for flexibility – we’ll always work
      with our clients to co-create the right model for their needs.
