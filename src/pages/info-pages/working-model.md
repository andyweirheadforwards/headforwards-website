    title: A new approach to software outsourcing
    text: >-
      Different clients look for different things from an outsource software
      partner. Headforwards offers two engagement models to ensure you get the
      right mix of quality and value for money. 


      Headforwards was founded on the belief that clients are short-changed by
      traditional software outsource companies – mainly due to the
      “on-the-bench” model of project resourcing.

      When you just pull whoever’s available off the bench to work on a client
      project, there’s no continuity, no knowledge retention, and no foundation
      of trust. Quality often suffers, and outsourcing can become a false
      economy.

    title: Two ways to work with Headforwards
    text: >-
      Headforwards has deliberately avoided that out-moded model. Instead, it
      focuses on forming effective teams who stay together long-term and
      continuously develop new ways to deliver value to the client.


      Companies can choose to engage Headforwards in one of two ways: as a
      long-term partner or for a short-term project.

    title: Long-term partnership
    text: >-
      The cloud has made continuous delivery the norm, so many clients are
      looking for long-term, ongoing and cost-effective support from their
      outsource partner. 


      For this kind of engagement, Headforwards works with the client to recruit
      the team, so everyone is confident the right people are on board, and a
      strong bond forms from the start.

    title: 'Short-term project '
    text: >-
      Not every organisation is looking for a long-term partnership. Some want
      to outsource a discrete short-term project, like a prototype, proof of
      concept or app. 


      Headforwards has formed a special projects team for short-term
      engagements, who will bring together the right people to deliver each
      project.

      It’s all about getting the right team on to the project. While we have two
      models in place, there’s still room for flexibility – we’ll always work
      with our clients to co-create the right model for their needs.
