    title: The power of the mob
    text: >-
      An entire dev team, gathered around one computer, all working on the same
      client project. It sounds like chaos, but it’s a brilliant way of
      delivering high quality software, fast. 


      Mob programming is used a lot at Headforwards. It’s a chance to apply a
      whole team’s ideas and knowledge to one project – and because they test as
      they go, any bugs can be instantly squashed.

      Mobbing keeps everyone on the same page. Everyone agrees how the software
      will be coded, issues are picked up on fast, and we’re quicker to spot
      potential traps in the process.
