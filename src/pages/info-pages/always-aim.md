    title: Realistic expectations
    text: >-
      Doing the right thing sounds straightforward, but it can be one of the
      most challenging aspects of running a business. The secret? It’s all about
      creating a culture of openness, transparency, and trust.  


      Software development is traditionally driven by two things: money and
      deadlines – but racing to meet deadlines can cause big problems with
      quality and delivery.  


      Headforwards adopts a different approach, taking the time to understand a
      client’s vision, focusing on what’s achievable, and prioritising the work
      in line with Agile principles.


      It believes this is the best way to deliver quality work, and its clients
      think so too.

      We’re in the game of setting expectations with clients, we’re completely
      open about that. We’d rather deliver clients something of value that does
      exactly what they want, than promise something unrealistic.

    title: 'Trust is everything '
    text: >-
      Headforwards’ client relationships are based on a solid foundation of
      trust – maintained by a culture of complete transparency. 


      Through honest and frank conversations with clients the company is able to
      build stronger relationships, and work to its full potential – which means
      a better end product and happier customers.

      Whether it’s an internal team, or a relationship with a client, trust
      should dominate everything.

    title: 'Principles are second nature '
    text: >-
      Headforwards has few formal working rules. Instead it relies on people’s
      positive attitudes to work responsibly and transparently to get the job
      done. 


      What’s more, integrity is an invaluable attribute for all of its people –
      something the company prides itself in fostering.
  - quote: >-
      If we ever get things wrong, we’re the first to hold our hands up and say
      so. By doing that, it’s worth its weight in gold for the client
      relationship, not least because it’s the right thing to do anyway.
