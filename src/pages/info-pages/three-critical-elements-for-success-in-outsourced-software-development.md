          ### Clear communication 


          Close communication is vital for the success of any software development project. Indeed, this is at the heart of the agile and DevOps methodologies. Both these frameworks enable close collaboration between team members, so that mistakes always translate to learning, ensuring that development becomes an iterative process. Where an outsourced partner is used, it is important that communication remains a top priority – even although there may also be language barriers, different cultures, or time zones to consider. Video calls and other web-based methods can be used to make sure communication continues to flow smoothly and that everyone works closely as one team throughout the process.

          ### Clear metrics 


          It is essential that any outsourced software development project has clearly agreed metrics at the outset and that both parties fully understand how a project’s success will be measured. Not only must there be agreement and clarity about the final outcomes, but also full agreement about all milestones along the way and all crucial timeframes.

          ### Clear vision


          The outsourced software development company should always aim to understand the big picture.  It is vital to have a good understanding of the client’s overall strategy and where their project fits into the whole. It is only then that the software development company can consistently make the right decisions at every level in the company and truly deliver against the client’s business objectives. 


          As the sector continues to grow and mature, outsourcing will be regarded as essential for delivering cutting edge IT innovation. As a result, outsourced software development companies will increasingly be seen as vital strategic partners. It is an exciting time to be at the forefront of this trend, helping to shape the software industry of the future.
