          With a timeframe of 12 months or more, Headforwards always recruit and
          create the core team in close partnership with clients. \r

          \r\r

          A typical team might contain at least 2 dedicated software
          engineers, an Agile facilitator and a Product Owner or Product
          Manager. \r

          \r

          A Product Owner works closely with client to translate their
          strategy into a roadmap and prioritised backlog items. A Product
          Manager is able to explore the product strategy, value proposition and
          customer testing as well as clarifying risks and assumptions. "
