    At Headforwards, we understand that happy people do better work. That’s why
    we provide a range of employee benefits and community activities to keep
    people smiling.

          We recently asked our employees what they thought of the benefits we
          offer, and got some great feedback on what people appreciated and what
          they felt we could do better. 


          We’ve since given people five days more annual leave, a salary
          sacrifice car leasing scheme and a medical cash plan. 


          And that’s just the start – we’re constantly looking to improve our
          offerings to staff to make sure they’re as happy as possible.

          We have events going on all the time, and they’re not just for
          employees. Friends and family are welcome to a wide range of
          activities designed to appeal to everyone.

          Employee wellbeing is always hot on our agenda. That’s why so much
          effort is put into organising social and community-orientated
          activities that benefit people both inside and outside the
          organisation.


          Photos of our team are just as likely to show the founding partners
          cooking at a barbecue or someone raising a glass of ‘Devhops’ – one of
          our home-brew beers – as they are someone coding at their computer.


          The annual highlight of these events is Headstock, our very own
          mini-festival – a whole weekend in the summer where friends and family
          are invited to camp and eat great food in the heart of the Cornish
          countryside.

          make a huge difference – things like champagne on your birthday.
