          You could also insert Somerset, Bournemouth, Devon... well, we are next to
          Devon I suppose! But Cornwall is 125 miles long, we are actually pretty
          far from Devon here at at Headforwards! We are always surprised at how
          many people don't really know where Cornwall is. If people have been on
          holiday here they have usually driven down and probably endured a bank
          holiday or end of school gridlock on the M5 and A30. We've all been
          there,it can take a long time to get here, but it is worth it! What was
          the most surprising thing people learnt about travelling to Cornwall? That
          you can get a 45 minute flight from Newquay to Heathrow, Manchester,
          Birmingham - and we have direct flights to Europe too.
