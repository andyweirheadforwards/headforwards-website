        Now we’ve talked about [the practicalities of building an outsourcing
        partnership](https://www.headforwards.com/insights/why-outsourced-software-development-works/),
        it’s time to explore what happens next. Once you’ve decided to
        outsource, it becomes a question of who – and where – you choose to do
        your work. 


        There’s a lot of jargon to navigate in the IT world – and outsourcing is no exception. 


        So, let’s break down the difference between onshoring and offshoring for outsourced software development and evaluate some of the pros and cons. We’ll also pose a new question about how you outsource: in an age of widespread remote working and digital collaboration, does it even matter where your partners are based?

        text: "If you’re outsourcing to developers on other continents – like sending
          your work to China or India from the UK, for example – you’re
          farshoring. \r

          \r

          It’s historically been a source of incredibly low-cost code
          work, from a huge pool of developers, which can dramatically decrease
          the outlay of a project while ensuring there’s specialist talent
          available to work on it. \r

          \r

          However, choosing such a distant destination for your
          outsourcing can affect collaboration. Say you’re sending work from
          Manchester out to Beijing – the seven-hour time difference can make it
          near-impossible to have real-time interactions with your offshore
          team. For some straightforward projects, that can actually be a
          benefit; working asynchronously means your coding is essentially done
          overnight and will be waiting in your inbox the next morning. But for
          complex projects that require a lot of back and forth, you’ll risk
          major delays as you wait for responses. "

        text: "Nearshoring is the middle ground between farshore and onshore work (more
          on that below). You send your work out to another country, but one
          that’s close by – often sharing a border. \r

          \r

          For a company in the United States, nearshoring usually
          means outsourcing to Mexico, or even Canada. Central European
          countries like Germany and France might venture to somewhere like
          Poland. This offers the access to specialist skills and the
          cost-savings of developing in cheaper countries, within similar time
          zones for ease of collaboration.  \r

          \r

          That proximity means you’re unlikely to come up against the
          cultural differences or language barriers that can make farshoring
          impractical. Plus, keeping your projects within your continent can
          make key considerations such as regulatory compliance and data
          sovereignty easier to manage. "

        text: "Keeping the developers you work with close is a great way to maintain
          control of your projects while managing costs. For example, if you’re
          based in a major city, wages and living costs can be sky-high. Move
          out to some of the smaller centres, and you can develop your software
          in a more affordable environment. \r

          \r

          This is the ideal approach if you want to work really
          closely with the development team, without the risk of language
          barriers or disparate time zones getting in the way. But what you gain
          in terms of logistics, you can lose in terms of budget and access to
          skills. Often, onshoring remains a pricier alternative to offshoring,
          and you’re still confined by the talent that’s available nearby. By
          looking further afield, there’s no limit to the skills you can hire. "

          people](https://www.headforwards.com/what-we-do/build-strong-relation\
          ships/). And it can be difficult to build that vital connection
          between people over long distances and through video calls. However,
          that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s impossible – it just requires a new
          approach.\r

          \r

          We believe that collaboration works best when people have
          the opportunity to share ideas and develop code together directly.
          This won&#39;t always happen face to face – but a long-term
          partnership deserves a real investment of time and effort. That&#39;s
          all dependent on the partner you choose, not where they&#39;re
          based.\r"

          form](https://www.headforwards.com/how-we-work/collaboration/); giving
          our clients high-touch partnership support anywhere in the world.
          It&#39;s all about knowing how to find the best way of working
          together, whether a client is practically next door or based on the
          other side of the world.\r

          \r

          Some of our approaches, such as [continuous
          delivery](https://www.headforwards.com/how-we-work/continuous-deliver\
          y/), produce the highest standard of work when they&#39;re conducted
          with all the stakeholders and developers working closely together.
          When we do [mob
          programming](https://www.headforwards.com/how-we-work/mobbing/), for
          example, we like to invite the client to join our team for a session
          or two, whether that&#39;s in-person or via video conference.\r

          \r

          In the past, the debate between onshoring and offshoring has
          been much more clear-cut: onshoring is simpler but more expensive, and
          offshoring is cheaper but can be logistically difficult. But now,
          there are always workarounds to ensure clients are getting the best of
          both worlds.\r

          \r

          It&#39;s easy to forget in the world of technology and
          coding, but good partnerships – and great work – come from remembering
          how important the human element is. With [the right
          team](https://www.headforwards.com/what-we-do/create-effective-teams/)
          working on a project, there are always new methods to get everyone
          working together and pulling towards the best outcome. It&#39;s an
          approach that we&#39;re always striving to perfect, and if that sounds
          like a partnership that appeals to you, [let&#39;s
