      There’s no one size fits all solution to software development. It’s why
      Headforwards works closely with you to deliver software that creates value
      for your organisation. 


      Headforwards abides by one of the Agile Manifesto’s core values: customer
      collaboration over contract negotiation. That’s not to say it doesn’t
      believe in contracts – rather it believes problems are better solved
      together with the client.

      We work with our clients to deliver tangible business value. That only
      comes from engaging key stakeholders at every stage – even sometimes
      embedding them within our own teams.

    title: 'The right team for each project '
    text: >-
      No two clients or projects are the same. That’s why Headforwards works
      with each client to create the right team for their needs; a team that
      stays in place for the entire life of the project. 


      Clients can draw on the team’s software development experience, knowledge
      and ideas, all of which can contribute to better decision-making and
      better quality software.

      We want to be a partner to our clients, to develop long-term relationships
      with trust on both sides. With a dedicated team in place, trust and
      collaboration build over time, and we come to a shared and seamless way of
      working.

    title: A faster way to become Agile
    text: >-
      Some organisations want to move to an Agile approach, but legacy processes
      and modes of software development get in the way. That’s where
      collaborating with Headforwards can help.  


      By partnering with Headforwards, large organisations can immediately
      benefit from its Agile approach to software development – something that
      can be hard to achieve in-house.

    title: A flexible approach to collaboration
    text: >-
      Headforwards may be an Agile outsource partner, but there’s nothing
      dogmatic about its approach. The company believes that the most value
      comes from working with each client to establish the most productive way
      of working.
  - quote: >-
      We believe in people and teams over dogma and principles. If we can get
      everyone to work together effectively, we’re going to get a much better
      result for everyone.
