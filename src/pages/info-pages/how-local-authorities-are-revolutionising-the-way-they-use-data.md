        across the UK, BI is one key area where important early wins are
        emerging. The use of data solutions and business intelligence is
        increasingly regarded as the key to smart decision making, enabling

          Digital transformation is being driven by two factors. Firstly, budget
          cuts from central government and secondly, a growing appetite for
          digital services from citizens, who are increasingly familiar with
          using the internet in other parts of their everyday lives. As a
          result, they expect the same effective 24/7 interface with their local
          authority. 


          Bob continues: 


          > The ultimate goal is that by streamlining data and making more effective use of BI, local authorities can deliver better services to citizens, improving quality of life for everyone in the local community.

          >

          > By creating a centralised data warehouse, storing all the data from multiple sources right across the local authority, this can generate reports that can be easily analysed across each of our key areas of Finance, Performance and People. By joining up the various strands of data that used to be siloed in manual systems that were difficult to manage and interrogate, we get a better overall picture of community needs, as well as vital insights into our performance and clarity about where service improvements can be made.

          This overarching digital approach also creates the opportunity to
          deliver an improved service to customers.  It removes the need to
          repeat or duplicate information, streamlines the whole process, and
          provides citizens with a smoother experience when they interact with
          local authorities.


          > Not only does this allow us to establish clear corporate KPIs, it enables us to use our budgets in the best possible way, increasing our efficiency and reducing overheads. By implementing BI in this way, we are laying the foundations for a sustainable future.

        text: "As one of the largest unitary authorities in the UK, and one where
          multiple historic district councils have been brought together,
          Cornwall Council stands to reap significant benefits from the new
          approach to BI.  \r

          \r

          Local authorities provide a wide range of services, ranging
          from waste collection and car parking to housing, education and social
          care. To run these effectively, having access to management
          information and the ability to analyse it effectively is vital.  "

        text: >-
          When it comes to local authority work such as social care and public
          safety, a crucial part of the decision making is when and where to
          apply the service or intervention. Many local authorities are now
          starting to move from reporting on what happened in the past to using
          predictive analytics. 


          By utilising past data, BI systems can generate a prediction for outcomes on new cases. These predictions can be used as crucial decision- making support. Again, this enables an improved service to citizens, as the ability to analyse data on key factors and identify patterns provides an opportunity for early intervention. It also creates a way to review performance across services and pick up potential future problems before they occur. 


          Bob says:


          > We are moving to a system where intelligent data is at the heart of the organisation and therefore can inform all our decision-making. Going forward, our data will be dynamic and interactive and easily interrogated by officers. As part of this, we will make full use of Open Sourced data within our systems, so we are sharing instant access to wider data as well as our own. We have started a programme of building in open data to our common datasets - for example, data on population, deprivation, crime and so on. This enables people across the organisation to deliver their own comprehensive reporting in a ‘self-service’ manner

          > One element that is key to making this work effectively is rolling
          out what we refer to as common datasets.  For example, this could be
          population estimates - we put those into the data warehouse and
          encourage everyone to use those in their reporting. This means that
          two different people in separate parts of the organisation can produce
          numbers that are identical and then have a conversation from a solid
          foundation. This will create a step change in efficiency.

          >

          > To make the most of BI, we also need to imbue a data driven culture into working practice right across the organisation. The new systems will only create maximum value if our people fully understand the benefits of data-driven decision making and put this at the heart of their everyday working. So, at Cornwall Council, we are also focused on creating culture change within the organisation, up-skilling our people and enabling new attitudes and working practices. We believe that organisational culture change is an essential part of any BI programme and should underpin it. This is the crucial element that could mean the difference between success and failure.

          services can be better aligned with demographic need. It can also
          highlight where a problem may be looming and allow early intervention.
          This all leads to better performance and ultimately a new and more
          agile approach to local government.” "
