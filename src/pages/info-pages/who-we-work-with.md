      With dedicated teams created for each client, Headforwards looks to
      develop long-term client partnerships that continuously deliver business
      value. 


      Relationships between the client and the team are given time to grow,
      teams get to know the client’s goals and requirements in greater detail,
      and the software produced is closely aligned with the client’s needs.

    title: Partnerships built on trust
    text: >-
      Headforwards teams produce their best work when trusted to self-organise
      and approach each project in their own way.


      Working closely with the client throughout the process, the best
      partnerships rely on each other’s expertise to develop software uniquely
      suited to the client’s requirements.
  - quote: >-
      One of the biggest challenges in software development is problem solving,
      and our teams have unique ways of approaching it. When partnerships have a
      strong foundation of trust and communication, the challenge becomes much
      easier to overcome.

    title: Agile mentality
    text: >-
      Headforwards teams excel through the use of Agile processes, which means
      clients with an Agile mindset can get the greatest value from its teams. 


      When both client and teams take a flexible approach to projects, they can
      easily collaborate to tackle issues and changes in direction, avoiding the
      challenges associated with waterfall-style project cycles.
  - quote: >-
      Our Agile approach to software development means we’re not well suited to
      companies that insist on traditional processes – but those willing to
      adapt to an Agile mindset can see huge results with us.
