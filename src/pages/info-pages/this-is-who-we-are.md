    text: >-
      Headforwards believes clients get the greatest business value when Agile
      development teams are empowered to make their own decisions.


      Clients look to Headforwards to develop software that creates value. In a
      rapidly changing business environment, what constitutes value might change
      from one week to the next.


      Software can only deliver business value if development teams can adapt to
      changing client needs. For Headforwards, that comes from being Agile in
      the way they work with clients.

      If something changes in our client’s world, they've got to adapt, they've
      got to look for a new competitive advantage in their software and that’s
      always what we aim to deliver.

    title: 'We believe in being Agile, we believe in empowering teams'
    text: >-
      The Agile Manifesto says quality software emerges from self-organising
      teams. That’s why there’s no management layer at Headforwards. Instead,
      decision-making responsibility lies with the team working on each client
      project.


      When team members feel empowered and engaged, they work to their full
      potential, and it shows in the quality of the software they deliver.

      the client really benefits from that.
