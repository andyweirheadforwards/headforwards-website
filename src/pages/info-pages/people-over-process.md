          People make or break a project, so getting the right people and
          helping them to be the best they can be, is an essential part of us
          doing great work for our clients. 


          Unlike many software developers, Headforwards is people-centric rather
          than process-orientated, placing a strong focus on finding the right
          people and helping them develop their skills. 


          The result is an environment that rewards creative, independent
          thinking, and Headforwards’ clients recognise the benefits this
          approach can bring to their projects.

Right from the off, both Headforwards teams and clients are included on instant messaging channels and deployment systems. \n\n\rThis creates complete transparency – so clients not only see what work is being done, they can react to it immediately with their thoughts and feedback."

      Everyone in my team is equal, and they each bring important skills and
      knowledge to the table. In my role as a Scrum Master, I work with
      influence and competency, rather than authority and seniority.

That’s why an initial workshop with the client at the start of the relationship is key. \r\n\nIt’s an opportunity for clients to establish their exact requirements, so the team at Headforwards can estimate the project’s scope, and even make a start the very same day."

      Our people are so much more than developers. Yes, they design and build,
      but they also test, deploy, and provide on-going support. It means they’re
      responsible and accountable for the full project lifecycle.

For a team to gel well enough to do great work it needs great coaching and strong, supportive relationships.  \n\n\rThese relationships are at the heart of everything Headforwards does, and play a big part in the great service the company offers to its clients."

      It’s important to get teams working together to be the best they can be.
      This can only happen if your people gel and build their own relationships
      before building one with a client.
