      Everyone in my team is equal, and they each bring important skills and
      knowledge to the table. In my role as a Scrum Master, I work with
      influence and competency, rather than authority and seniority.

      One of the first things I tell clients when we bring them on board is:
      ‘when we deploy through our systems, you’ll see when it succeeds, but
      you’ll also see when it fails.’ That’s how open it is.

      Our people are so much more than developers. Yes, they design and build,
      but they also test, deploy, and provide on-going support. It means they’re
      responsible and accountable for the full project lifecycle.

      t’s important to get teams working together to be the best they can be.
      This can only happen if your people gel and build their own relationships
      before building one with a client.
