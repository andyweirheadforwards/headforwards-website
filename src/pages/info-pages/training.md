      When it comes to talent development Headforwards doesn’t rely on
      traditional training programs. Instead it has created an open,
      knowledge-sharing culture where those eager to progress can learn from
      some of the best in the business—and share their own experiences in turn. 


      For the curious, dedicated and determined, this presents the perfect
      opportunity to advance their skills and discover where their ability can
      take them.

      An appetite for learning is a key characteristic of a Headforwards team
      member, so self-motivators will find ample opportunities to learn from
      their peers. 


      As well as its emphasis on knowledge sharing, Headforwards organises event
      visits, courses and expert-led talks to help its people stay up to date
      with the latest industry developments. 


      Mini-workshops also provide regular opportunities to exchange ideas, learn
      from each other and practise important skills like public speaking.

      We love self-motivators. If you come to us and show us a course that will
      benefit you and the way you work, then we will make that happen.

    title: 'The career progression framework '
    text: >-
      Self-directed learning is great, but it’s also important that people know
      what opportunities are available. That’s why Headforwards developed a
      framework to help its employees identify potential career paths. 


      Typical of its inclusive environment, Headforwards’ career progression
      framework was developed together with the whole team, so everyone has
      input into their own development.

      If you want to be surrounded by the latest technology and really
      intelligent people that are always open to sharing knowledge, then this is
      a great place to learn and progress your career.
