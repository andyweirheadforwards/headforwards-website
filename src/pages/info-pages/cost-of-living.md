          People often think that it is really expensive to live in Cornwall. Yes,
          there are lots of people who have second homes here, and yes the cost of
          housing is increasing. It is true that in some areas local people struggle
          to buy, but isn't that the case everywhere? Living on the sea front in St
          Ives or Falmouth is pretty pricey, but there are plenty of houses in other
          coastal towns and villages which are very reasonable. Houses a bit
          furtherinland can be even cheaper to rent and to buy. Housing close to our
          office is very reasonable and it is still only 4 miles from the beach.

      One bedroom places are from £450 a month to rent. Some of our staff have
      mortgages on 3 bedroom houses with garages, for £550 a month. It honestly
      isn't as expensive as you might think.
