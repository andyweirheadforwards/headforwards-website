          ## How we work


          Our Agile approach to software development brings value to your business from the start.


          We work to understand your business context and define projects around your objectives.  Depending on your needs, our teams may be augmented with temporary developer resource or product, technical and facilitation consultancy. This flexibility can assist in rapid team creation and - in turn - rapid project starts. 


          Headforwards believes that great software is built by great teams. We believe in people over process and build our teams based on each job’s specific needs to make sure our clients get the right product. 


          We believe that all software deserves to be treated this way, irrespective of size of project or roadmap.

          [**Proof of Concept**
          →](https://share.hsforms.com/1aRrvaaplSQC-3z6Gqj-G8Qzec3)


          To prove whether a software idea can be built in the real world, what technologies should be used and whether the software is likely to be adopted by its intended users.


          [**Initial Product Development** →](https://share.hsforms.com/1aRrvaaplSQC-3z6Gqj-G8Qzec3)


          Developing and launching a new product to market requiring a rapid development cycle, strategy support, UX design and customer testing all in close client collaboration.


          [**Enterprise Project** →](https://share.hsforms.com/1aRrvaaplSQC-3z6Gqj-G8Qzec3)


          A stand-alone software project to boost enterprise capabilities to support their goals. Often our clients either don't have development teams themselves or are at capacity with other work.


          [**Augmented Team** →](https://share.hsforms.com/1aRrvaaplSQC-3z6Gqj-G8Qzec3)


          A long-term dedicated team in situations where budget or other constraints don’t allow a full, cross-functional team. This model offers access to bursts of support or specialist expertise as and when appropriate.


          [**Consultancy** →](https://share.hsforms.com/1aRrvaaplSQC-3z6Gqj-G8Qzec3)


          A wide range of workshops and coaching engagements specific to a client’s needs from Vision and Roadmap creation to Agile coaching and Agile transformation support.
