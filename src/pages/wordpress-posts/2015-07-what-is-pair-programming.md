You may have been wondering “what is Pair Programming?” Well it is one of many exciting techniques used in Agile Software Development.

It works by having two programmers working side by side on the same workstation. One monitor, one keyboard, one mouse.  
The team members switch regularly between two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.  
Essentially the Driver writes the code whilst the navigator simultaneously reviews it.

It is the Navigators job to consider their strategic direction as well as identifying potential issues and possible improvements. Doing this ensures the driver can focus all their attention on the tactical aspects of the task.

It may seem counter intuitive to have two people working on a single computer, but when pair programming is done correctly it can increase software quality without a negative impact on time to delivery.

There are a few things to consider when taking the leap into Pair Programming:

It involves a special set of social skills that can take a little while to learn. It will feel awkward and unusual at the start, and it does take a little while to get the hang of it. Most reports say as much as a month.

The team must be polite and courteous with each other, trying hard to not offend each other’s egos. No one person is superior to another in peer programming, even if one person is a more senior member of the team. In these scenarios it is important not think of it as a mentoring exercise because you are both working together as equals. This enables a better transfer of skills.

This is not a silent exercise, rather ‘programming out loud’. There should be a constant dialogue between the team, which leads to clearer articulation of the coding complexities. It is important to say what you are going to do but also ask for ideas and better ways to solve the problems. Make sure you are also listening.

Optimise the space you are working in. You both will be sharing a desktop, monitor, keyboard and mouse. Pair programming will not work properly if you are squashed into a tiny workspace, with lots of external distractions looking at a screen that is too small to share.

You need to pay attention. The Navigator should be reading the code in real time. Their job is to review the code, whilst thinking of ways to simplify and improve it. They need to be looking out for any potential bugs and bringing up errors right away. The driver should be actively thinking about how to achieve the current task and not just passively typing. These actions require immense concentration, it will not work if you are checking your phone, chatting to external parties about the weather or drifting off into space.

It is also important to stay in synch with each other. It is common for you to slightly slip out of synchronisation whilst you are working but it is important to then stop and get back in synch quickly. If you are working with a few minutes between each of you, then you may as well be working alone. This re-synching isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it could actually cause you to work together as a better pair.

Don’t stay in the same pair all day; you need to mix up your partners. A good time to switch is when you both become stuck on an issue. One of the team members is replaced by someone from another pair who can come in and look at the issue with fresh eyes. You should be switching pairs a couple of times a day.

You should also regularly switch roles within your pair. The Driver becomes the Navigator and the Navigator becomes the driver. There are different schools of thought on the time frame for this varying from 5 mins, 15 mins to 30 mins. The key point is not to stay in the same role for too long.

So, these are our top tips for effective Pair Programming:

Be polite.  
Talk to each other, programming out loud.  
Create an efficient, spacious workspace.  
Pay attention.  
Stay in Synch.  
Mix up the teams.  
Switch roles.

Pair Programming may seem like a controversial technique, why have two people working on the same task? When actually other industries have been doing this for years, think airline pilots or perhaps more obviously [rally drivers.](http://www.codriversolutions.com/codriving.htm)

It isn’t wasteful to have two people working together, they are not just doing one persons work. One is coding whilst the other is looking ahead.

Pairing also reinforces good programming habits and enables you to spend more time in ‘flow’ – that sweet spot of highly productive work where you are totally focused on the code.

Pair programming is a really beneficial technique, and one that should be added to any Agile teams toolbox.

What I will say is that it is imperative to trial it for at least a month before making a decision. It does take a while to get to grips with the practise and to gain the best rewards.

Oh, and watch out for coffee breath.
