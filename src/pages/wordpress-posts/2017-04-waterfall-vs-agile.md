Making the right decision for your team, the project and your client is critically important. There are many different practices available to follow within the ever-changing world of software development. Two of the most popular are Waterfall and Agile.

One of the best ways to imagine how this process function is with this analogy:

**Waterfall** – A traditional, procedural approach to software development. Defined steps with a clear start and end. Difficult to implement changes to scope without collateral damage.

**Agile** – Adaptive planning, evolutionary development with frequent and continuous delivery. Responsive to scope change without harming the project as a whole.

**Did you know?**

Both Waterfall and Agile go back a long way to the early days of software development. The earliest version of Waterfall was implemented by the US Department of Defence in 1985. There are, however, records going back to 1976 in a paper by Bell and Thayer. A form of using Agile software development methods can be traced back to 1957 – “Iterative and Incremental Development: A Brief History” by C. Larman ; V.R. Basili

### **Waterfall Methodology**

![](//headforwards.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/waterfall-vs-agile-header-3.jpg)

Waterfall development is a linear process and looks similar to this layout:

1.  Requirement Analysis
2.  Design
3.  Implementation
4.  Testing
5.  Deployment
6.  Maintenance

The descriptions for each step may have different meanings or terms to some people but overall, the process is the same. In a strict waterfall project, each of the above represents a distinct stage of the cycle. Stages must complete in the order they are specified.

Waterfall is common in software development. More so in smaller development lifecycles and “one-off” projects. The stages are clearly defined and give clients a beginning, a middle and an end.

**The Good**

The outcome is discussed and planned at the start. This gives the team a better idea of the project lifecycle.

The presence of the client isn’t required after the requirements stage. For some clients, this may be a benefit if they do not have time during the development and testing phase to discuss technicalities.

There may less of a modular feel to the final product as it has been constructed in a single sprint.

**The Bad**

Misunderstanding the requirements. It may feel like the client spec is open and transparent with lots of technical clarification. But, is it what they need? Is it even feasible? If there are too many holes in the requirements and you can’t clear them up early on, you’ve got a big problem.

**The Ugly**

Time’s up. The original schedule set out for the project has been heavily underestimated. The project overruns, the client pulls out, no dice.

The client doesn’t like it. It doesn’t do what they asked it to do and budget is overspent. In this scenario, nobody is happy. People start reaching for contracts and drawing up plans for attack.

Things can turn really sour with this process, but it is important to point out that Waterfall can be very effective in the right scenarios and shouldn’t be overlooked.

### **Agile Methodology**

![](//headforwards.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/waterfall-vs-agile-header-2.jpg)

Take a linear project timeline and break it down into each task. Next, break the final product down into individual functional components. In an Agile world, these tasks and features are placed in order of business value and time-boxed into phases known as sprints.

Each sprint will take a set of features right through from concept to deployment. Every sprint will have a time limit. Here at Headforwards these span 2-3 weeks depending on other factors such as manpower and other time constraints.

Short sprints with clear deliverables in short intervals have pros and cons, just like Waterfall.

Agile development pros and cons crossover. Some can be seen as an advantage as well as a disadvantage so here are the key points to take away:

**Transparency**

A great perk for the client is being able to see exactly how the project is progressing. An Agile setup will allow this with short sprints outlining clear goals set by the client.

**Pole position**

Looking to deliver a just-in-time product? Does it need to be ready for a rapidly moving market sector? Having a minimum viable product ready to launch in a short timeframe is advantageous over a fully-loaded waterfall style end product. “The product is ready but there’s no demand anymore.”

**High levels of client interaction**

This can be a huge benefit to the development of the project and will, in most cases, align with the client’s business values. However, this may be a problem for them; they may not have the time to engage in the project at the level an Agile environment demands. Without close involvement from the client, the project may not run as smoothly as intended. Features may be overlooked and the project as a whole may stray off the path.

**Making a Decision**

Both methods have their pros and cons. We’ve only listed a few of the most important ones above. It’s worth having a look at case studies by software companies to see how they operate.

So how do you decide? You may already think you’ve made your mind up about which path to take which is great! It’s worth asking some really important questions before making that final decision:

**Customer Availability**

Is your client able to drop in on each iteration and major decision? Can they attend retrospective sprint meetings? Agile requires a good working relationship with the client to successfully deliver the end product(s). If your client would rather leave you and your team to get on with it, take the Waterfall method. Otherwise, Agile will be more effective with a responsive and engaged client.

**Scope**

Is the product specification likely to change? Will your client start dropping in new features during the process? If they are looking for an MVP style build, Agile is the way to go. If they’re happy to sign off the requirements at the very beginning, Waterfall is the best option. But often requirements change as they see what is possible

**Is there a Priority?**

If the client is signing off the entire spec from day one, take the waterfall approach. If they are looking to see functionality early on and have a list of things they want to see up and running, Agile wins with an MVP approach.

**Financials**

Cost plays a big part in the final decision. In a typical Waterfall setup, the cost is finalised after the analysis stage and signed off with the client before work commences. The work is then completed and payment is made. With Agile, it is more likely that the costs are ongoing if the client wishes to add new features to the backlog for future development. Instead of an overall fee, there may be a standard “day rate” or monthly / yearly contract fee.

**Conclusion**

Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages. The purpose of this exercise is to analyse and choose the right path for your team, your client and the project. Even if you’re a huge believer in Agile, it could be harmful to a project that simply does not require iterative modular development and high client engagement. Here at Headforwards, we have been implementing Agile from day one but are always open to new ideas and processes to build projects in the future. We are constantly looking for new ways to increase our understanding of the software development lifecycle and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
