Due to rapid expansion, we have sought out a new premises to allow for an increase in organisational capacity. This extra office space will allow for the creation of new job opportunities and assist in attracting a skilled labour force to the area. It is part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund.

The new space which is located on the campus grounds of Cornwall College (Trevenson Campus), has given us the ability to work towards the acquisition of new clients. There are 6 new offices in total. The new spaces will be able to seat a minimum of 80 people, not including social spaces and meeting rooms.
