Ruby on Rails Developer (status: Closed)
----------------------------------------

**Description:**

Headforwards are looking for mid to senior level Rails developer to help build the back-end for a new high-end web application. The primary app is a JSON API for a JavaScript front end; therefore the focus is much more on solid data and business logic skills than on HTML templates, view helpers, etc. However there will be some basic full-stack work (admin pages etc.) required as well.

**Experience and skill requirements:**

*   *   Fluency with Ruby and Rails
    *   Dedication to good test suites along with good code
    *   Understanding of relational databases and general data modeling / design patterns
    *   Debugging/troubleshooting ability
    *   High productivity and willingness to learn

**Experience with the following would be ideal, though not required:**

*   *   RESTful JSON APIs
    *   RSpec for unit tests
    *   Cucumber for integration tests (this API call from the client with this database state should yield this JSON result)
    *   factory\_girl for fixtures
    *   Interactor for bridging controllers and models
    *   Sidekiq for background jobs
    *   PostgreSQL
    *   Writing SQL directly (not just through AR)
    *   Search engines (at the use-as-a-service level)
    *   Cloud ops (at the “I know how to find my way around AWS Console and Heroku” level)

Core hours are 5 days a week, 8.5 hours per day (9:00-17:30) Monday-Friday, including 1 hour lunch break.

**Location:** Near Redruth, Cornwall, UK

**Salary or rate:** Varied dependent on experience – comparable to most UK industry levels
