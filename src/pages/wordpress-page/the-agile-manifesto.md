The Agile Manifesto
===================

_The Agile Manifesto is also sometimes referred to as the Manifesto for Agile Software Development._  
_It is the formal declaration of the guidelines for working in an iterative way with a people focused approach to software development._

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

**Individuals and interactions _over_ processes and tools**

**Working software _over_ comprehensive documentation**

**Customer collaboration _over_ following a plan**

**Responding to change _over_ following a plan**

That is, while there is value on the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

The Principles behind the Agile Manifesto
=========================================

We follow these principles:

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face to face conversation.

Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

Simplicity- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done- is essential.

The best architectures, requirements, and design emerge from self-organizing teams.

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.
