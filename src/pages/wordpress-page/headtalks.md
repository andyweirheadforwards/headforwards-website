### Headtalks – The Internal Technical Conference

We believe that professional and personal development are important factors to a happy and productive team, and we do all we can to facilitate them.

One of the ways we do this is by holding a monthly internal tech conference, called **Headtalks**. These talks allow us to encourage thought leadership and knowledge sharing, whilst giving our team an opportunity to share their ideas with a large audience. We have decided to share these talks with the public to give other software and tech enthusiasts a taste of what it is like to work at Headforwards.
