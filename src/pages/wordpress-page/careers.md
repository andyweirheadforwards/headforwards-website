### **What's our stack?**

It depends - we are language agnostic! We love new tech and any opportunity to use it. The majority of our development is done using open source technologies. 

**Our most popular languages:**

`C#, Python, Perl, PHP, JavaScript`

**Frequently used services, tools and frameworks:**

`Docker, ElasticSearch, Jenkins, SpecFlow, Selenium, ReSharper, DynamoDB, MongoDB, NodeJS, Entity Framework, AWS Lambda, Team Foundation Server, Redis, InfluxDB, Git and Kafka, Angular.`

**What we're excited about:** `Golang`

We encourage knowledge sharing with internal conferences each month, weekly show and tells and the odd hackathon. We do of course have core languages but we always try to use the right tool for the job!

### What's the deal?

We believe in people. Team happiness is extremely important to us, that is why we try our best to make sure you are happy and having a great time at work. We do the basics like offer good salaries, flexible hours and great benefits. But we want to go further than that. You are all individuals with your own desires and passions, and we treat you that way. In your work you have autonomy to make decisions and impact resutls.

If you want to take a longer lunch break to go surfing, you can, you just make up the time. Maybe you'd like to play Lasertag, badminton or go for a run. We have lunchtime clubs set up for this and showers on site. You may prefer the robot club where you can develop & build robots using Raspberry Pis. We try to make the most of our amazing location with beach BBQs after work and an end of year festival called [Headstock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2GL8sMAOKA).

We even brew our own beers!

Agile-Ale and BDD have been much enjoyed over the last few years. Our next beer, Dev Hops,  was named in a competition at Agile on the Beach. The team got to all go for a tasting and now it is time to brew the beer! 

Do you want to try Dev Hops?

### Cornwall - a Thriving Tech Hub

In the past 2 years, Cornwall has been ranked in the top 5 growing tech clusters in the UK.

It has more Fibre to Premises than any other region in the UK, with speeds of up to 300MBPS and the highest usage in the UK! This has contributed to the thriving tech scene here. Cornwall has a history of being home to engineering pioneers, now  digital pioneers are at the forefront of the tech industry. 

At Headforwards we are constantly striving for improvement and using the latest technologies. We have a very diverse team which leads to interesting and often surprising results. We encourage thought leadership and self-development as much as possible. We hold an internal conference every month - [Headtalks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6EL0AsCvG7duu-PVsSQIXg/videos), and regularly attend external conferences to help stay up to speed with this fast-moving industry. 

We are a truly Agile company, with a flat hierarchy. We mainly work in a Scrum, XP, Kanban hybrid and have embraced exciting methodologies like TDD, Mob programming and Continuous Delivery - one of our teams is now releasing software 18 times a day across 6 global regions.

### What's it like to live in Cornwall?

In one word? Amazing! Cornwall is a fantastic place to live and work.

We like to help our team make the most of our location so we host monthly social activities including beach BBQs after work and bowling or cinema trips. We are also flexible with working hours which allows for a number of activities at lunchtime or before/after work. 

You will find that the cost of living here is significantly less than major UK cities.  You can rent a 1 bedroom flat near our offices for £500 per month and a 3 bedroom detached house by the beach 5 miles away for £900. Staff who relocate here find that even if their salary is lower than in London, they have a lot more disposable income, which is never a bad thing. 

All of our roles are based in Cornwall, there is no remote working and we all benefit hugely from collaborating and sharing knowledge.

*   Truro voted 9th best place to live in the UK by Rightmove.

We’d love to hear from you if you are considering a move to Cornwall or if you’d just like to find out more about our roles. It might be that you start your career elsewhere and join us in a few years. 

### What about our teams?

Most of our teams are dedicated to one client each. There is constant work and no sitting on the bench here!  You'll always be working, always be learning and always collaborating. Our teams do have core languages, depending on the client and their requirements.  Wherever possible, we will use something new to supplement our core development.  We're not afraid to try new things, we're not afraid to fail. There is no failure, only feedback.

*   .NET Developers
*   Full Stack JavaScript Developers
*   Python Developers
