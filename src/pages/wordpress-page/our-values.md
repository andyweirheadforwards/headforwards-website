Our values
==========

It is our belief and experience that successful organisations and businesses are those that have a true understanding and passion of who they are and what they have set out to achieve.

At Headforwards this understanding and passion is firmly rooted in our three core values:

**Happy Clients**

**Great Software**

**Effective Software Teams**

These intertwined values guide our decision making from the strategic to the tactical to the day-to-day.

At Headforwards we are committed to delivering business value for our clients through their software and software choices.

Flip that on it’s head and you have our definition of great software: enabling clients to achieve their business objectives.

In order to create this great software we believe in bringing together excellent software professionals and giving them the ability to work together effectively and efficiently as a team.

**We believe in people.**

The people we work with are an integral part of our business, and we believe in treating them in that way.  
Company culture is something we think carefully about, and try to empower our team to have the right work life balance.

This ultimately leads to a happy and productive workplace where people are creating work they are proud of.
