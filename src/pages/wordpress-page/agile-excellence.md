[Agile](http://www.headforwards.com/2015/06/what-is-agile/) excellence is something we strive for here at Headforwards.

The term Agile is being used all over the software development world, but sometimes it is thought of as just a buzz word by people that may not fully understand it’s usefulness.

However Agile as a philosophy, is actually fairly simple.

There are many branches of the Agile tree including Scrum, Kanban and XP. These are frameworks that describe different methods of cultivating an Agile environment.

Similarly, the software practices described in XP are simple tools that better equip the software team to accommodate changes in requirements.

Whilst Agile as a concept may be relatively simple, the practise is sometimes not.

Here at Headforwards we take Agile excellence seriously, as it enables our teams to develop better software, in an extremely efficient way.

We have gained a lot of experience in setting up and running successful Agile teams.  
This is done by selecting the appropriate application of Agile frameworks and tools to fit our clients organisation and software projects.

Through implementing the ideas of continual improvement, systems thinking and empiricism, Headforwards ensures its clients always get the best out of their Agile teams.

[The Agile Manifesto](http://www.headforwards.com/the-agile-manifesto/) is something that we follow, and will give you a better idea of how we work.

_“We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it._

_Through this work we have come to value:_

*   _Individuals and interactions over processes and tools_
*   _Working software over comprehensive documentation_
*   _Customer collaboration over contract negotiation_
*   _Responding to change over following a plan”_
