The Headforwards team all gathered at [Porthtowan](https://www.visitcornwall.com/beaches/north-cornwall/st-agnes/porthtowan-beach#.Vdrdi9NVhBc) beach, [Cornwall](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/england/southwest-england/cornwall) for a late summer BBQ.

As you know the Headforwards team love to socialise together, and we really do make the most of living and working in [Cornwall](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/england/southwest-england/cornwall). We often meet up outside of work and head to the beach, we just did this for a late summer BBQ that was a great success.  
We cooked and ate some yummy food whilst enjoying the last of the sun.

Some of the team went swimming whilst others went surfing, it is great to having such wonderfully clear sea on our doorstep.

A summer BBQ is a great team building exercise, especially as it is in a relaxed and friendly environment.  The developers bring their partners and children and we all get to know each other a bit better.
