      “What’s the big deal, said the alien. ‘So I had a tidy-out, dumped some
      stuff. The coolant needed draining so there’s that, and I had to un-box a
      few spare parts for the repairs. What’s it matter? There are a million
      planets. What makes this one so special? I mean, who cares about a bit of
      rubbish? What difference does it make?’
