    The annual Agile on the Beach conference, co-founded by one of Headforwards’
    founders, Toby Parkins is now one of the most respected agile conferences in
    the UK with a growing international audience. It’s an opportunity for Agile
    practitioners to come together to hear from some of the leading voices in
    Agile and best practice, but it’s also a great place for people to get to
    understand the principals of an Agile methodology. For our local authority,
    Agile on the Beach sparked the question, “How could we become more Agile?”
