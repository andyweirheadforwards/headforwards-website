We will only ever use your data in the way you intended it when you provided it to us. This should be explicitly clear, if you are unsure please contact us. We will regularly review and revise our privacy policy, to ensure you are protected.

This policy was last updated on 24th May 2018.

**Personal Data**
-----------------

Whilst using our website, software applications or services, you may provide us your personal information (name, address, email, account details, etc.). We will use this information to administer our website, applications, client databases and marketing material. We will ensure that all personal information supplied is held securely in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as adopted into law of the United Kingdom in the Data Protection Act 2018.

**How do we collect information?**

Headforwards Solutions Ltd collects information in two possible ways:

*   _When you directly give it to us (“Directly Provided Data”)_

When you communicate with us, you may choose to voluntarily give us certain information – for example, by filling in text boxes or completing registration forms. All this information requires a direct action by you at that time in order for us to receive it.

*   _When you give us permission to obtain from other accounts (“User Authorised Data”)_

Depending on your settings or the privacy policies for other online services, you may give us permission to obtain information from your account with those other services. For example, this can be via social media or by choosing to send us your location data when accessing our website from your smartphone.

**How long do we keep your data for?**

Headforwards Solutions Ltd will not retain your personal information for longer than necessary. We will hold onto the information you provide either while your account is in existence, or as needed to be able to provide the Services to you, or (in the case of any contact you may have with our Customer Care team) for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only.

If legally required, or if it is reasonably necessary to meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce our Terms and Conditions, we may also retain some of your information for a limited period of time as required, even after you have closed your account or it is no longer needed to provide the Services to you.
