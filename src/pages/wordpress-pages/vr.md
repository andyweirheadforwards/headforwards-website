VR (Virtual Reality) is huge. While it is typically used within the gaming industry, we have been working on a VR experience to help people visualise what it is like to be part of Headforwards. Our new VR app enables you to meet a team of developers in a Q&A session, observe one of our daily stand-ups, and be a fly-on-the-wall in one of our .NET development rooms. To view the current Android beta release, all you need is a VR headset and our app, which is available to download for free below. As soon as we get out of beta, you will be able to download from the app stores.
