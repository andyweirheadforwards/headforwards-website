.NET Developer Careers
======================

Are you looking for to take the next step in your .NET Developer career? We have some exciting opportunities available for you.

We are an outsource software development company who specialise in forming dedicated teams of people for individual clients on long-term development contracts.

This is very different to the traditional ‘agency’ outsource software development model where you may find yourself sitting on a bench waiting for work, or being switched between projects.

You will be constantly coding for just one client on a single project which gives you a sense of consistency and leads to personal development as well as better software development.

We currently have a number of clients looking for .NET Developers to join their teams.

The roles:
----------

We are in the process of recruiting 3 more .NET development teams.  
Two of these teams are for an existing healthcare client who are increasing their outsourcing with us.

The third team is for a new client who works in the travel industry.
