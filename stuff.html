<p><strong>Full Stack Azure Developer up to 50K depending on experience</strong></p>
<p>Would you like to work somewhere
    that has truly embraced Agile ways of working? Somewhere that pushes boundaries and will massively improve your
    skills as a Developer. TDD, Mob Programming, Continuous Delivery... read on!</p>
<p>You will be joining a high
    performing team of developers in our office in Cornwall, with very occasional travel to the client site in Kent.
    This is a .NET Azure based Microservices application with a React front end. It will handle 25 million requests a
    year, managing the creation and distribution of digital and physical outputs for our client. The team works with a
    Product Owner at the client site and is heavily involved in the entire delivery process from definition and
    prioritisation of features through to the release and support of the deployed application. We are helping to
    modernise and streamline a key process within our client.</p>
<p>We have embraced agile ways of working and are fans
    of TDD for new code. You will be implementing code across the full stack of the application, working in a small team
    of 3. There are 4 other .NET teams working for the same client, so they are your wider team :) Some of us have more
    back end experience, others are happier with front end or testing. It\'s a great mix of people and skills and
    you\'ll undoubtably learn from your own team as well as the others.</p>
<p><strong>Why work for
    Headforwards?</strong></p>
<p>We are a software development company with just over 100 people from 18 different
    countries and we like to have fun at work. We are agile with a very laid back feel, a relatively flat structure and
    small self-organising teams of 2-7 people. There\'s no pressure to work extra hours to churn out more and more code.
    At Headforwards, our culture and environment is dedicated to making people happy at work. We have lots of social
    activities and monthly learning sessions, talks and cross company communities of practice for various languages,
    tools and frameworks. This is a place where you can make a difference, work in a small team start-up feel but
    benefit from the support of a larger community of developers and like-minded people. We work in teams dedicated to
    various clients and we work on global projects with cutting edge technologies, tools and techniques. We live in
    beautiful Cornwall and our offices are less than 5 miles from the beach. We want to make sure our people have a good
    work life balance so that they can enjoy all that Cornwall has to offer :)</p>
<p>You might not think of Cornwall
    when you think about developing your tech career, but you\'d be surprised at the tech scene here! We work with
    global clients and some of our teams are releasing multiple times a day across multiple regions. We\'re continuously
    improving and striving to be better. Moving to Cornwall is definitely a lifestyle change if you haven\'t lived here
    before, but not at the expense of compromising your career. We honestly feel like we have it pretty good!</p>
